# Review of Last Week

## Course Policies

If you missed class last week, make sure you [read the syllabus!](../syllabus.qmd).

## Recap of Grading Policies

- Tag pages on Gradescope **which are relevant for a given problem** (labs this is the whole thing sans the intro/setup).
- Explain what your code is trying to accomplish **outside of the code block**.
  - For example: here are the equations you're implementing or this is how you're iterating through a problem.
- **When in doubt, ask!**
- Regrade requests should be made on Gradescope.

# Systems Basics

## What Is A System?

A system is:

::: {.quote}
> "an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something...
>
> A system must consist of three kinds of things: *elements*, *interconnections* and *a function or purpose*."

::: {.cite} 
--- Donella Meadows, *Thinking in Systems: A Primer*, 2008 
:::
:::

##  Why Are Systems Interesting?

::: {.incremental}
- "**Interconnected** set of **elements**"
- "**Function** or **purpose**"
:::

## Example: Climate Change

Changes to climate occur based on a variety of processes across scales, including:

- carbon sources/sinks;
- aerosol emissions;
- ocean heat uptake;
- surface albedo;
- El Niño/La Niña (ENSO)

## Example: Climate Change

## Example: Water Pollution

Contaminant levels in a body of water also depend on a number of processes which may have different scales and rates.

**Can we think of some?**

## System State

**System State**: quantities or variables which evolve over time based on external inputs and system dynamics.

The state gives you a "snapshot" of the system at a given point in time.

## Stocks and Flows

::: {.incremental}
- A **stock** is the amount of a system property: concentrations of a pollutant, numbers of currency units, etc.
- A **flow** is the way in which a stock changes: decay, diffusion, production, consumption, etc.
:::

## Residence Time

We can use the notion of stocks and flows to formalize the idea of **residence time**: average time a unit of a stock remains in the system (or a component of the system).

$$
\underbrace{\tau}_{\substack{\text{Residence} \\[0.5em] \text{Time}}} \times \overbrace{F}^{\substack{\text{Flow} \\[0.5em] \text{In/Out}}} = \underbrace{M}_{\text{Stock}}
$$

## Steady-State Residence Time

Steady-state condition on flows $F_\text{in}$ and $F_\text{out}$:

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\begin{gather*}
F_\text{out} = F_\text{in} = F \\
\Rightarrow \bbox[5pt, border: 5px solid red]{\tau = M/F}
\end{gather*}
$$
:::

## Simple Example

A college has a constant undergraduate enrollment of 15,000 students. No students flunk out or transfer, so the residence time is four years.

1. **How many students graduate every year?**
2. **How many students enroll every year?**

# Modeling Systems

## How Do We Develop Models?

::: {.incremental}
- Mass balance equations let us track changes in stocks at particular points;
- Equilibrium conditions are requirements that there is no net flow, and thus that stocks are preserved;
- Fate and transport modeling involves quantifying how stocks change as they move through the system.

## Deterministic vs. Stochastic Models

### Deterministic Models

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

x = [0, 1]
y = [3, 5]
plot(x, y, marker=:circle, markersize=10, linewidth=3, xlabel="Time", legend=:false, grid=:x, yticks=:false, yaxis=:false, ylabel="State", gridalpha=1, left_margin=8mm, right_margin=90mm, bottom_margin=10mm, color=:black, guidefontsize=18, tickfontsize=16, x_foreground_color_border=:white)
xticks!([0, 1], ["t", "t+1"])
ylims!((2, 6))
```

::: {.column width=50%}
### Stochastic Models

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

Random.seed!(12)
x = [0, 1] # hide
y = 3 .+ zeros(2, 8)
y[2, :] .+= (rand(8) * 4) .- 1

xticks!(0:1, ["t", "t+1"])
ylims!((2, 6))
scatter!([0], [3], color=:black, legend=false, markersize=10)

## Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Models

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

### Descriptive Models

- Used primarily for describing or simulating dynamics.
- Intended for *simulations* and *exploratory* and/or *Monte Carlo analysis*.

:::
::: {.column width=50%}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}

### Prescriptive Models

- Specify (prescribe) an action, decision, or policy.
- Intended for *optimization* or *decision analysis*.
:::
:::
::::

## Analytic vs. Numerical Solutions

Mathematical models can be solved:

1. **Analytically**: can find the exact solution in closed form;
2. **Numerically**: can only find solutions (exact or approximate) using computational tools.


## "All Models Are Wrong, But Some Are Useful"

::: {.quote}

> ...all models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind....

::: {.cite}
--- Box & Draper, *Empirical Model Building and Response Surfaces*, 1987
:::
:::

## What Are Models Good For?

::: {.quote}

> Models can corroborate a hypothesis by offering evidence to strengthen what may be already partly established through other means... 
>
>
> **Thus, the primary value of models is heuristic: Models are representations, useful for guiding further study but not susceptible to proof.**

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways (Systems)

- A **system** is an interconnected set of components.
- Systems are interesting because interconnections can result in unexpected outcomes.
- Key terms:
    - **state**
    - **stocks**
    - **flows**

## Key Takeaways (Systems Definition)

- To define a system, need to specify:
    - components
    - interconnections
    - control volume
    - external inputs
    - outputs of interest

## Key Takeaways (Models)

- Mathematical models allow us to understand how external inputs combine with internal system dynamics to produce outputs.
- Models can be **prescriptive** or **descriptive** depending on goal of analysis.
- For most interesting problems, cannot solve analytically and need to use numerical methods.

## Key Takeaways (Models)

- **Simulation** models: Generate data by evaluating model to represent system dynamics.
- **Optimization** model: Find parameters which maximize/minimize some criterion.

## Key Takeaways (Warning!)

- **All models are at best approximations**: be conscious of what assumptions you've made and how they might change the modeled outcomes (you will be asked to do this on homeworks).
