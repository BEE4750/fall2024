# Lake Eutrophication Overview

## What is Eutrophication?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
**Eutrophication**: common environmental problem in which plants and algae feed on excess nutrients and become overabundant.

## Effects of Lake Eutrophication

- **hypoxia** (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to "dead zones";
- **acidification**(from the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by decomposition);
- **reduced sunlight** (from an accumulation of surface algae);
- **clogged water intakes**; and
- **reduction in recreational value and drinking water quality**.

## Lake Eutrophication Dynamics

![Schematic of processes resulting in lake eutrophication](figures/eutrophication-system-schematic.svg)

## Lake Eutrophication Causes

Excess N and P can come from: 

- point sources (such as industrial/sewage processes); and/or 
- **non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff)**.

Excess nutrients are stored in sediment and recycled back into the lake, as well as transported by organisms/consumers.

## Non-Point Source Pollution

**Non-Point Source (NPS) Pollution**: Intermittent, distributed waste input to surface or groundwater

## Types of NPS Pollution

- **Excess fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides** (ag runoff)
- **Oil, grease, chemicals** (urban runoff, energy production)
- **Sediment** from constructions sites, crop/forest land, eroding streambanks
- **Salts** from irrigation and acid drainage
- **Bacteria and nutrients** (livestock, pet wastes, septic systems)
- **Atmospheric deposition**

## NPS Pollution Flows

## Management of Eutrophication

It can be difficult to restore to *oligotrophic* state:

- Reduce N and P going forward to reduce pressure;
- Remove and treat sediment/water;
- Biofiltration.

Restoration takes a long time and is not guaranteed (**hysteresis**)!

# Eutrophication Modeling Example

## Watershed As Environmental System

## Watershed/Lake Systems Diagram

![Conceptual Model of an Environmental System](figures/eutrophication-system-diagram.svg)

## Watershed/Lake Systems Diagram

![Conceptual Model of an Environmental System](figures/eutrophication-system-diagram.svg){width=70%}

- $V = 600 \times 10^6\ m^3$
- $A = 30 \times 10^6\ m^2$
- $Q_\text{in} = Q_\text{out} = 400 \times 10^6\ m^3/yr$

## Information Needs

1. What will happen to the waste in the environment (fate & transport)?
2. What are potential impacts and acceptable levels or critical thresholds?
3. *What are options to manage the waste?*

## Fate & Transport

**Common Approach**: Mass-Balance

$$\frac{\partial\text{Mass}}{\partial t} = \text{Inputs} - \text{Outputs} - \text{Decay}$$

## Fate & Transport

Assuming steady-state and decay is linear w.r.t mass:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial\text{Mass}}{\partial t} &= \text{Inputs} - \text{Outputs} - \text{Decay} = 0 \\
\frac{\partial(CV)}{\partial t} &= \sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i - CQ_\text{out} - \alpha CV = 0
\end{align*}$$

## Fate & Transport

$$
\begin{gather*}
\sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i - CQ_\text{out} - \alpha CV = 0 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad C(Q_\text{out} + \alpha V) = \sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i \\
\Rightarrow \qquad \bbox[5pt, border: 5px solid red]{C = \frac{\sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i}{Q_\text{out} + \alpha V}}
\end{gather*}
$$


## Other Ways To Write

$$
\begin{align*}
C &= \frac{\sum_i P_i/V}{Q/V + \alpha} \\[0.75em]
&= \frac{\sum_i P_i/V}{\tau_w^{-1} + \alpha} \\[0.75em]
&= \frac{\sum_i P_i/V}{\sum_j k_j}
\end{align*}
$$

## F&T Model Assumptions

**What does this model assume?**


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Steady-state ($\partial\text{Mass} / \partial t = 0$)
- 1st order (linear) decay
- Lake is:
  - Well-mixed
  - Constant volume
:::

## Environmental Impacts

**What are potential impacts and acceptable levels or critical thresholds?**

Generally need to limit average P concentrations to $< 0.01-0.02$ mg/L.

## Incorporating Threshold

$$\begin{align*}
C = \frac{\sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i}{Q_\text{out} + \alpha V} &\leq \left(0.01\ \text{mg/L}\right)\left(\frac{1\ \text{mg/L}}{1000\ \text{kg/m}^3}\right) \\[0.5em]
\Rightarrow \qquad \sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i &\leq \left(1 \times 10^{-5}\right) \left(Q_\text{out} + \alpha V\right) 
\end{align*}$$

## What Is The Decay Rate?

Vollenweider model for lake P sedimentation: 

$$\alpha = \frac{10}{\bar{H}} \approx \frac{10A}{V}$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\begin{gather*}
\Rightarrow \qquad \sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i \leq \left(1 \times 10^{-5}\right) \left(Q_\text{out} + 10A\right)  \\
\Rightarrow \qquad \sum_j PS_j + \sum_i NPS_i \leq 7000\ \text{kg/yr}  \\
\end{gather*}$$

## NPS from Watershed Land Use

| Type | Area (ha) | Unit P Load (kg/ha) |
|:----:|--------:|----:|
| Forest | 20,000 | 0.11 |
| Corn | 1,000 | 2.0 |
| Pasture | 3,000 | 1.0 |
| Residential | 1,000 | 1.2 |
| Business | 200 | 3.0 |

Unit loads taken from @Osmond1997.

## NPS from Watershed Land Use

| Type | Area (ha) | Unit P Load (kg/ha) |
|:----:|--------:|----:|
| Forest | 20,000 | 0.11 |
| Corn | 1,000 | 2.0 |
| Pasture | 3,000 | 1.0 |
| Residential | 1,000 | 1.2 |
| Business | 200 | 3.0 |

$$\sum_i NPS_i = 9000\ \text{kg}$$

## Implications...

In other words, the "typical" NPS load is

$$\sum_i NPS_i = 9000\ \text{kg}.$$

This is greater than the acceptable total P load for a target concentration of 0.01 mg/L!

**What can we do?**
:::


## Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Modeling

What we do next depends on whether we're taking a prescriptive or a descriptive approach.

::: {.incremental}
- **Prescriptive**: How should we treat PS waste/control NPS load to ensure compliance?
- **Descriptive**: How will the lake respond to different point and non-point source contributions?
:::


## What About Non-Steady State?

$$\sum_j PS_j(t) + \sum_i NPS_i(t) - C(t)Q(t) - \alpha C(t)V = F(t)$$

- More complex, may not be able to solve analytically! 
- Need to use numerical **simulation** methods (next week!)
