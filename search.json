You may need to copy the token (the numbers on the displayed url after ...token=) and paste that into the subsequent form.\n\n\nUsing BioHPC and Jupyter Lab\nOnce the connection starts, it should put you on a terminal. You can then clone repositories with git clone &lt;repository url&gt; and open the notebooks and files (Julia 1.10.4 is already installed by default). Note that the first time you run a notebook’s first cell, it might take a while to install the relevant packages.\nThe version of Jupyter Lab installed on your account has a git interface, so if you would prefer to not use the command line to interact with git, you can clone, push, and pull using the Git menu.\nIf you want to work with a standalone script (to write up your answers separately), rather than the notebook, you can create a new Julia script with a *.jl extension within the Jupyter Lab interface.\n\n\nExporting Notebook to PDF\nWe’re working on figuring out why there are some errors in direct exporting to PDF, but you can export a notebook to HTML with File -&gt; Save and Export Notebook As -&gt; HTML, open the saved HTML file in your browser, and save page as a PDF.

    "section": "Working On Your Local Machine",
    "text": "Working On Your Local Machine\nGetting set up for this course requires the following steps, if you haven’t done them for a previous course, club, or project:\n\nInstall git on your machine if necessary.\nInstall Julia using the juliaup tool.\nInstall and set up VS Code if you don’t already have an editor you’d like to use. VS Code is an editor of choice for Julia, as it as a rich and well-supported Julia extension. If you have a different coding environment, please find instructions for how to set it up to edit Julia.\n\n\nInstall Git\nIf you have already installed git, you don’t need to worry about this section. If you haven’t, download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac Versions\n\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, be aware if you have an Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) Mac or an Intel Mac. Many of the installations you will go through in this exercise have different versions for each processor type, and the program may not work properly if you still the wrong version. There’s nothing that can’t be undone, but it’s easier to be install the correct version first!\n\n\n\n\nInstall Julia\nI recommend installing Julia using the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\n\nInstalling Juliaup on Windows\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\n\n\nInstalling Juliaup on MacOS\nIf you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\n\nInstalling Julia 1.10.4\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.10.4 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njuliaup add 1.10.4\njuliaup default 1.10.4\nThis will install Julia 1.10.4 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\n\nInstall and Set Up VS Code\nYou can skip this section if you already have a coding environment you like; just set it up to work with Julia. Otherwise, VS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nInstalling VS Code\nYou can download it here; open the downloaded file to install.\n\n\nInstall the Julia Extension\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View. This view can also be found on the sidebar with the following logo:\n\n\n\nVS Code Extensions View Logo\n\n\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; talk to Vivek if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create *.jl files to write Julia code and execute line by line. However, we will primarily use Jupyter notebooks in this class, but this might be useful for testing code or for your project.\n\n\nInstall the Jupyter Notebook Extension\nThe Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to export a Jupyter notebook to PDF or to HTML and then to PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF Export for Gradescope\n\n\n\nYou will need to export every notebook to a PDF for submission to Gradescope. Direct export to PDF requires a LaTeX installation. If you would like to go this route, please look at the LaTeX installation instructions for your operating system.\nOtherwise, exporting to HTML and then using your browser to save the resulting page to a PDF is a perfect solution.\n\n\nFollow the same instructions as above, but search for jupyter and install the Jupyter extension. Restart VS Code.\n\n\nUsing GitHub with VS Code\nThis Youtube video provides an overview of how to use GitHub within VS Code (with chapters for specific steps) and may be worth watching.",

Groups do not have the be the same for all assignments. Exactly one member of each group should submit the solution. If you submit as a group, it is the responsibility of the submitter to tell Gradescope the names of the other group members. If this information is not entered, the other group members’ grades can be delayed or even lost. Also include the names and NetIDs of all group members on the first page.\nIf a student in BEE 5750 works in a group with a student from BEE 4750, they should submit separate PDFs to Gradescope (these can be different versions of the same PDF) due to the additional 5750 problem; this will just not be graded for the 4750 student(s). A single submission can be used for multiple students within the same course number who share a group.\nMore detailed homework instructions and logistics are available.\nSubmissions must be PDFs. Make sure that you tag the pages corresponding to each question; points will be deducted otherwise.\nTo convert the assignment notebook to PDF, you can use VS Code to render the notebook to HTML, and then use your browser to print to PDF.

    "section": "Making a Basic Plot",
    "text": "Making a Basic Plot\nLet’s walk through making a basic line or scatter plot in Julia, using Plots.jl1.\n1 There are some other plotting libraries in Julia, but Plots.jl is a standard starting point. Feel free to experiment, though!Since we’ll be generating random numbers, let’s import Random.jl to let us set a seed to reproduce the same plot in addition to Plots.jl.\n\nusing Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Measures\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(1);\n\nFirst, to generate a basic line plot, use plot():\n\ny = rand(5)\nplot(y, label=\"original data\", legend=:topleft)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also explicitly pass \\(x\\)-axis coordinates by passing an array with these coordinates first, as in plot(x, y, ...). If only one array is passed, Plots.jl will interpret the values as \\(y\\) coordinates and use their indices for the \\(x\\) positions.\nNotice the use of the label and legend keywords to label the plot element and position the legend. To not label a particular plotting element, use label=false, and to turn off any legend (including a colorbar) from the plot, use legend=false.\nNow we can add some other lines and point markers. We will use plot! and scatter! to add another line and some points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutating Function\n\n\n\nThe exclamation mark says that plot!() is a mutating function, which changes an existing variable instead of creating a new one. In this case, these functions change or add to an existing plot, instead of creating a new one.\n\n\nNotice the arguments in plot!() and scatter!(), which let us set properties for the line and scatterplot markers.\n\ny2 = rand(5)\ny3 = rand(5)\nplot!(y2, color=:red, linewidth=2, linestyle=:dot, label=\"new data\")\nscatter!(y3, markercolor=:black, markershape=:square, markersize=5, label=\"even more data\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now add axis labels. We can use LaTeX syntax to add mathematical markup elements to labels (such as superscripts, subscripts, Greek letters, and mathematical symbols) using the LaTeXStrings.jl package. If we indicate that a string should be interpreted as a LaTeXString using the L\"...\" syntax, it will render content inside $..$ using LaTeX, as seen below.\n\nxlabel!(\"Regular String (days)\")\nylabel!(L\"LaTeX String $x_2$ (m$^3$)\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Plot Elements\nSometimes we want to remove legends, axes, grid lines, and/or ticks.\n\nplot!(legend=false, axis=false, grid=false, ticks=false)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this unintentionally modified the image dimensions to move the axis labels off the page. If we wanted to keep them, we could modify the dimensions with plot!(size=...).\n\nplot!(size=(400, 400))\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lesson is that sometimes the Plots.jl defaults don’t look ideal, and we need to adjust sizes and margins.\n\n\nAspect Ratio\nIf we want to have a square aspect ratio, use ratio = 1.\n\nv = rand(5)\nplot(v, ratio=1, legend=false)\nscatter!(v)",

    "section": "Assignments (Homework, Labs, and AEs)",
    "text": "Assignments (Homework, Labs, and AEs)\n\nHow do I access assignments?\nWe will use GitHub Classroom to manage assessments. Links to accept the assignments and create your repository will be posted on Ed Discussion as they are released, and posts with the links for active assignments will be pinned. The class schedule will link to a page which has a preview of the assignment, but links are not provided from this page to accept the assignment.\nFor the first assignment you accept, you will need to link your GitHub account to your entry in the class roster. You will not need to do this again for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nWhat if there’s an error in the assignment repository?\nThat’s certainly possible! If you believe I’ve made a mistake in writing the assignment, please document it in the Ed Discussion forum. I’ll describe steps for how to fix your files (unfortunately, I can’t do this remotely and push it to everyone’s repositories).\n\n\nHelp! My code isn’t working.\nHere are some steps I would follow:\n\nSearch for the error message you’re seeing. Often, you can find posts in the r/Julia subreddit, the official Julia forum, or Stack Overflow for the same or similar issues. You should do this first: if you can find the answer this way, it will be faster than other options, and if you can rule out some approaches that you’ve already tried, it will make the following steps go more smoothly.\nPost on Ed Discussion. For the most effective help, follow the following guidelines (adapted from Stack Overflow’s “How Do I Ask A Good Question?”):\n\nMake your post subject specific and descriptive. “Problem with HW 1 Problem 3” makes it hard for other members of the class community to know if they’re having a similar issue or if they can help. Since the TA and I may not be checking Ed religiously, you’ll get faster responses if other students feel prepared to help.\nIntroduce the problem. What have you tried? What error message are you getting? Have you been able to identify a specific line of code or section of code that’s causing the problem?\nProvide code. It’s very difficult to get a sense of what might be going wrong if you just say that you have a problem, even if you share the error message. If you have a small question (you can demonstrate the error with a brief snippet of code), you can directly put this into your Ed post, but otherwise, please provide a link to your GitHub repository and where to find the relevant codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Your Repository!\n\n\n\nYou must commit and push your current files to GitHub prior to asking for help, or we won’t be able to see the code that you’re having trouble with.\n\n\n\nCome to office hours. If you can identify the problem, but we’re having trouble solving it via Ed or more urgency is required, please come to office hours and we can try to work through the issue. This is most helpful if you’ve already done some problem-solving on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive Yourself Time To Problem-Solve\n\n\n\nWaiting until the last day or two to start an assignment can cause problems if you don’t have time to work through the following steps. If office hours are busy and you haven’t gone through the prior steps, you may be prioritized below than students who are have, and we may not have time to solve your problem. Running into coding challenges is not a valid reason to get an extension on an assignment!\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you help me debug my code?\nYour first task should be to identify what part of your code works as desired, to help narrow down where the bug could be. If your code is broken into functions or smaller blocks, set up simple tests to make find which block(s) are causing the problem. If your code is just one big script, try to divide it into logical sections, then conduct these tests. Once you identify the part of the code that is not working, go line by line to see what particular command is doing something unexpected. Once you’ve identified what line is doing something strange, try to search for how to solve the problem and/or post on Ed with your code snippet (actually copy the code into the post or provide a link to your GitHub repository, with the line number; do not paste a screenshot) and a description of what you’re trying to accomplish and what the specific problem is.\nIf you are not sure how to articulate what your code is trying to do (or are similarly unsure how to divide your code into logical units), that suggests that your problem is not debugging, but rather conceptual: step back and try to write out the logic of your code and how it aligns with the strategy you’ve developed to solve the problem. It might be that there is a conceptual problem rather than a bug, which we can definitely discuss!\nIf, however, you’ve tried the above steps and cannot figure out the bug, come to office hours, but if you have not done the above steps (and so cannot point to where exactly you’re running into a problem and cannot describe what that part of code is trying to accomplish), we will ask you to figure that out on your own first. Otherwise, we cannot fruitfully help — nobody is more familiar with your code and problem-solving strategy than you are.\n\n\nHow do I get a PDF of my notebook for submission?\nThere are two main options, depending on what you’ve already got set up on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Notebook Cells Before Submission\n\n\n\nRemember to “Run All” cells prior to conversion and submission, or else we won’t see your results!\n\n\n\nIf you have a Python installation, you can use a tool called nbconvert to convert to a PDF (if you also have LaTeX installed) or HTML (and then you can use your browser to print to a PDF).\nIf you don’t have a Python installation, within VS Code, you can use IJulia.jl (which will be included in the environments provided with assignments in this class) as follows (enter these commands into the REPL) to open your notebook in your browser:\nusing IJulia\nnotebook()\nThis should open a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser. Navigate to and open the notebook, and once it has completed running, go to File -&gt; Print Preview in the browser menu and Print to PDF.\n\n\n\nHow do I submit my PDF to Gradescope?\nThe instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag Pages\n\n\n\nMake sure that you mark/tag the pages corresponding to each question! Otherwise, we will deduct 10%. If a problem spans multiple pages, tag them all; if a page includes multiple problems, tag it several times. You may lose points if part of your answer is untagged (these will not be returned through a regrade request).",

    "text": "Overview of Economic Dispatch\nA key goal in power systems operations is how to meet demand by generating electricity from a variety of generators with varying costs and engineering constraints, including: * ramping limits; * minimum/maximum power outputs; * network constraints (we will ignore these here).\nEconomic dispatch refers to solving this problem with an objective of minimizing total costs of production. Economic dispatch is typically formulated as a linear programming problem, and we will use JuMP to formulate and solve it for a simple portfolio of generators over: * a single period * multiple periods with ramping constraints."

though hydro is effectively zero-cost, we reduce dispatched hydropower in hour 4 because coal is at its minimum generating capacity and nuclear can’t be ramped down further. These constraints complicate the simple merit order that we previously saw.\nThese constraints also play a major role in systems with high levels of renewable penetration. For example, the so-called California “duck curve” is created by the challenges of ramping generation between the early afternoon, when solar generation is at its maximum, and in the evening, when solar generation is decreasing and demand increases rapidly.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Duck Curve"

All external sources, including classmates, must be properly credited and referenced.**\n\n\nIf something is submitted with your name on it, you should be able to explain and defend its choices and outcomes. This is true in the workplace as well as in academia.\nFor example, see:\n\nThe Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity;\nThe American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics.\n\nThis issue is particularly important in engineering, as lives and well-being depend on the honesty and integrity of engineers. While the stakes are obviously lower in our class, the habits you develop now are related to your practices in the future.\n\nCite Your Sources and Collaborators\nThis course is designed to be highly collaborative: you are free to work with classmates, seek out their advice and insights when you are stuck, and provide help to them when they are stuck. You are also highly encouraged to take advantage of external resources to help you solve problems. But you must cite your sources, with only three exceptions:\n\nHelp from the instructor or course staff;\nCourse materials from this semester;\nSources used in prerequisite courses.\n\nSubmitting someone else’s work or ideas without proper credit is plagiarism, even if you have their permission. Plagiarism, and facilitating plagiarism, are academic integrity violations and will be treated accordingly. Conversely, citing your sources will never negatively impact your grade, and may help if you relied on poor information which you then used properly.\n\n\nUse Your Own Words\nDuplication of any source, even with proper citation, is plagiarism. Your submissions must reflect your own ideas, understanding, and work. This means:\n\nVerbatim copying of lecture notes (including code samples) is plagiarism;\nCopying from old homework or exam solutions is plagiarism;\nSubmitting work in your name done by another student is plagiarism;\nAllowing another student is submit your work in their name is an academic integrity violation.\nMinor wordsmithing to change individual words while preserving a duplicated text’s flow of ideas is also an academic integrity violation. For example, taking ChatGPT output and copying it is clearly an academic integrity violation; changing a few words here or there to avoid “duplication” is still a violation.\n\nThis also goes for any code that you submit. While you are welcome to draw on sources such as ChatGPT or Stack Overflow for debugging, syntax help, or programming patterns, you should independently incorporate these ideas into your independently written problem solutions and code (and credit them in the comments!). If the instructor or TA ask you to explain what is going on in your code, and you cannot, there’s a problem.",

You will be potentially be asked to derive mathematical versions of models, apply concepts from class, and interpret model outputs. The problems are largely short- or medium-answer.\nIn general, the same homework grading rubric applies to exam problems, as appropriate (.e.g. nothing about code). The deadly sins will still be penalized, and your solutions should be clear with transparent and well-communicated reasoning.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe exams are closed-book and closed-note, and closed everything else. No medically unnecessary electronic devices are allowed to be used during the exam, including headphones and smart watches.\nExams are also strictly confidential until the conflict and accomodation exams have been taken. Do not discuss your exam with anyone in person or online. Once all exams are taken, we will discuss the exams in class.\n\n\nDifficulty\nWhile we will not hand out sample exams, exam problems will be closer in difficulty to lab or exercise problems than the homework, since you have two full weeks to solve the problem and have full acccess to external resources, course staff, and classmates.

This lets us release solutions and return grades ASAP.\nRequest extensions ahead of the deadline. Justified extensions will only be granted for university-approved reasons or emergencies such as illness, injury, learning accomodations, etc and will be limited to 1-2 days, depending on the circumstance. Deadlines in other courses, job interviews, etc. are not reasons for extensions. Ask yourself if the circumstances leading to your extension request only interfered with submission due to poor planning or because they rendered you incapable of work and/or submission. Extensions requested after the deadline will only be considered prior to solution release and for extreme circumstances (e.g. hospitalization during the last day; hence limited communication access).\nUnder extreme circumstances, we will forgive assignments. There are circumstances under which a 24 hour extension is insufficient, such as long-term illness or serious injury. In these cases, we will compute your course grade as if the forgiven assignment never occurred, which will result in your exams and other assignments having more weight.",

We recommend talking to Prof. Srikrishnan or your TA about grading concerns before submitting a regrade request, but no grades will be changed outside of a formal request through Gradescope.\nAll regrade requests must include a brief justification for the request or they will not be considered. Good justifications include (but are not limited to):\n\nMy answer agrees with the posted solution, but I still lost points.\nI lost 4 points for something, but the rubric says it should only be worth 2 points.\nYou took points off for something, but it’s right here.\nMy answer is correct, even though it does not match the posted solution.\nThere is no explanation for my grade.\nI got a perfect score, but my solution has a mistake (you will receive extra credit for this! see below!)\nThere is a major error in the posted solution; here is an explanation (full credit for everyone, but Prof. Srikrishnan will decide what constitutes a “major error”! see below!).\n\nWe will only regrade what you submitted. Any “new” information in the regrade request will not be considered beyond the justification (any explanation may help us identify where to look if your solution is different than the official solution but correct, but the submitted answer must be interpretable as a correct solution on its own merits.\nThe first regrade request will be handled by the member of the course staff who graded the problem. If Prof. Srikrishnan did not review the first request, he will handle any subsequent regrade requests for the same submission. Once Prof. Srikrishnan issues a response to a regrade request, further requests for that submission will be ignored.\nIf you submit a regrade request correctly reporting that your problem was graded too leniently, your score will be increased by the difference (we want to reward this type of honesty and self-awareness!). For example, if your score was 8/10, and you point out that you should have gotten a 3/10, your score will be a 13/10.\nIf a significant error is found in the official solutions, everyone in the class will receive full credit for the relevant (sub)problem.

    "text": "Problems (Total: 50/60 Points)\n\nProblem 1 (30 points)\nA river which flows at 6 km/d is receiving waste discharges from two sources which are 15 km apart. The oxygen reaeration rate is 0.55 day-1, and the decay rates of CBOD and NBOD are are 0.35 and 0.25 day-1, respectively. The river’s saturated dissolved oxygen concentration is 10m g/L.\nIf the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in Table 1, write a Julia model to compute the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first wastewater discharge to an arbitrary distance d km downstream. Use your model to compute the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration up to 50 km downstream and how far downriver this maximum occurs.\n\n\n\nTable 1: River inflow and waste stream characteristics for Problem 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nRiver Inflow\nWaste Stream 1\nWaste Stream 2\n\n\n\n\nInflow\n100,000 m3/d\n10,000 m3/d\n15,000 m3/d\n\n\nDO Concentration\n7.5 mg/L\n5 mg/L\n5 mg/L\n\n\nCBOD\n5 mg/L\n50 mg/L\n45 mg/L\n\n\nNBOD\n5 mg/L\n35 mg/L\n35 mg/L\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem:\n\nPlot the dissolved oxygen concentration from the first waste stream to 50 km downriver. What is the minimum value in mg/L?\nWhat is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of organic waste) for waste stream 1 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 2 remains untreated? How about if only waste stream 2 is treated?\nSuppose you are responsible for designing a waste treatment plan for discharges into the river, with a regulatory mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether you’d opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other information might you need to make a conclusion, if any?\n\n\n\nProblem 2 (20 points)\nThe simplest climate model involves capturing changes to the Earth’s energy budget (it is commonly called the energy balance model, or EBM). These changes are also called radiative forcings (RF), and can result from several causes, including greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic eruptions, and changes to the solar cycle. The EBM treats the Earth as a 0-dimensional sphere covered with water, which absorbs heat in response to radiative forcings. Chanwith global temperature changes resulting from imbalances in the average (over the entire surface area) heat flux.\nThe EBM equations are:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overbrace{\\frac{dH}{dt}}^{\\text{change in heat}} &= \\overbrace{F}^{\\substack{\\text{radiative} \\\\ \\text{forcing}}} - \\overbrace{\\lambda T}^{\\substack{\\text{change in} \\\\ \\text{temperature}}} \\\\\n\\underbrace{C}_{\\substack{\\text{ocean heat} \\\\ \\text{capacity}}} \\frac{dT}{dt} &= F - \\lambda T \\\\\nc\\underbrace{d}_{\\substack{\\text{ocean} \\\\ \\text{mixing depth}}} \\frac{dT}{dt} &= F - \\lambda T,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(c = 4.184\\times 10^6 \\mathrm{J/K/m}^2\\) is the specific heat of water per area, \\(d\\) is the depth of the ocean mixed layer (we’ll assume \\(d = 86 \\mathrm{m}\\)), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the climate feedback factor and controls how much the Earth warms in response to increased radiative forcing (assume \\(\\lambda = 2.1^\\circ \\mathrm{C}/(\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^2\\))). The total radiative forcing \\(F = F_\\text{non-aerosol} + \\alpha F_\\text{aerosol}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is an uncertain scaling factor reflecting aerosol-cloud feedbacks (we’ll assume \\(\\alpha = 0.8\\)).\nThe code below loads historical and projected radiative forcings (under the SSP5-8.5 future emissions scenario, which is the most extreme of the scenarios used to project climate change impacts) from data/ERF_ssp585_1750-2500.csv into a DataFrame object and calculates the non-aerosol and aerosol components of those forcings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook closely at and experiment with the code below: DataFrames are a common Julia datatype for tabular data, and you may work more with them later in the semester or beyond! They are broadly similar to DataFrames from pandas in Python.\n\n\n\n\n# Dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/3973015\n# The CSV is read into a DataFrame object, and we specify that it is comma delimited\nforcings_all = CSV.read(\"data/ERF_ssp585_1750-2500.csv\", DataFrame, delim=\",\")\n\n# Separate out the individual components\n# Get total aerosol forcings\nforcing_aerosol_rad = forcings_all[!,\"aerosol-radiation_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol_cloud = forcings_all[!,\"aerosol-cloud_interactions\"]\nforcing_aerosol = forcing_aerosol_rad + forcing_aerosol_cloud\n# Calculate non-aerosol forcings from the total.\nforcing_total = forcings_all[!,\"total\"]\nforcing_non_aerosol = forcing_total - forcing_aerosol\n\nWe can plot the aerosol and non-aerosol forcings below.\n\nt = Int64.(forcings_all[!,\"year\"]) # Ensure that years are interpreted as integers\np_forcing = plot(; xlabel=\"Year\", ylabel=\"Radiative Forcing (W/m²)\")\nplot!(p_forcing, t, forcing_aerosol, label=\"Aerosol Forcing\", color=:blue, linewidth=2)\nplot!(p_forcing, t, forcing_non_aerosol, label=\"Non-Aerosol Forcing\", color=:red, linewidth=2)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem:\n\nDiscretize the EBM to produce a simulation model of global mean temperatures \\(T\\) over time as a result of total radiative forcings \\(F\\).\nSimulate global mean temperature anomalies (in \\(^\\circ C\\) relative to 1750) from your model using the historical and SSP5-8.5 radiative forcing data. Use an annual time step for the simulation (in seconds: \\(\\Delta t = 31,558,152 \\mathrm{s}\\)). You can assume \\(T(0) = 0^\\circ C\\). Plot the resulting temperature simulation.\nThe climate feedback factor \\(\\lambda\\) is one of the key uncertainties in projecting future temperatures, even assuming a particular scenario of future radiative forcing. Suppose we use the following distribution for \\(\\lambda\\), \\[\\lambda \\sim \\text{LogNormal}(\\log(2.1), \\log(2)/4).\\]\nUse Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected temperature in 2100 assuming SSP5-RCP 8.5 radiative forcings (with 95% confidence intervals). How does this estimate compare to the value you got from your simulation using the expected value of \\(\\lambda=2.1^\\circ \\mathrm{C}/(\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^2)\\)? How did you decide your sample set was sufficient?\n\n\nProblem 3 (10 points)\nThis problem is only required for students in BEE 5750.\nA factory is planning a third wastewater discharge into the river downstream of the second plant. This discharge would consist of 5 m3/day of wastewater with a dissolved oxygen content of 4.5 mg/L and CBOD and NBOD levels of 50 and 45 mg/L, respectively.\nIn this problem:\n\nAssume that the treatment plan you identified in Problem 1 is still in place for the existing discharges. If the third discharge will not be treated, under the original inflow conditions (7.5 mg/L DO), how far downstream from the second discharge does this third discharge need to be placed to keep the river concentration from dropping below 4 mg/L?",

The goal of passadieci is to get at least an 11 from rolling three fair, six-sided dice. Your strategy is to compute the average wins from 1,000 trials, but the code you’ve written below produces an error.\n\nfunction passadieci()\n    # this rand() call samples 3 values from the vector [1, 6]\n    roll = rand(1:6, 3) \n    return roll\nend\nn_trials = 1_000\noutcomes = zero(n_trials)\nfor i = 1:n_trials\n    outcomes[i] = (sum(passadieci()) &gt; 11)\nend\nwin_prob = sum(outcomes) / n_trials # compute average number of wins\n@show win_prob;\n\nMethodError: \nMethodError: no method matching setindex!(::Int64, ::Bool, ::Int64)\nStacktrace:\n [1] top-level scope\n   @ ~/Teaching/BEE4750/website/hw/hw01/hw01.qmd:215\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2 (5 points)\nYou’ve been handed some code to analyze. The original coder was not very considerate of other potential users: the function is called mystery_function and there are no comments explaining the purpose of the code. It appears to take in an array and return some numbers, and you’ve been assured that the code works as intended.\n\nfunction mystery_function(values)\n    y = []\n    for v in values\n        if !(v in y)\n            append!(y, v)\n        end\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\nlist_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n@show mystery_function(list_of_values);\n\nmystery_function(list_of_values) = Any[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\nIn this problem:\n\nExplain the purpose of mystery_function.\nAdd comments to the code, explaining why and how it works. Refer to “Best Practices for Writing Code Comments”, and remember that bad comments can be just as bad as no comments at all. You do not need to add comments to every line (in fact, this is very bad practice), but you should note the purpose of every “section” of code, and add comments explaining any code sequences that you don’t immediately understand.\nIs there a built-in Julia function that does the same thing as mystery_function? If so, what is it? Use it to do the same thing as the code above.\n\n\n\nProblem 3 (10 points)\nYou’re interested in writing some code to remove the mean of a vector.\nIn this problem:\n\nWrite a function compute_mean(v) which sums all of the elements of a vector v using a for loop and computes the mean.\nMake a random vector random_vect of length 10 using Julia’s rand() function. Use your compute_mean() function to calculate its mean and subtract it from random_vect without a loop (using a Julia technique called broadcasting; feel free to consult the Julia documentation and search as necessary). Check that the new vector has mean zero.\n\n\n\nProblem 4 (20 points)\nCheap Plastic Products, Inc. is operating a plant that produces \\(100 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\) of wastewater that is discharged into Pristine Brook. The wastewater contains \\(1 \\text{kg/m}^3\\) of YUK, a toxic substance. The US Environmental Protection Agency has imposed an effluent standard on the plant prohibiting discharge of more than \\(20 \\text{kg/day}\\) of YUK into Pristine Brook.\nCheap Plastic Products has analyzed two methods for reducing its discharges of YUK. Method 1 is land disposal, which costs \\(X_1^2/20\\) dollars per day, where \\(X_1\\) is the amount of wastewater disposed of on the land (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)). With this method, 20% of the YUK applied to the land will eventually drain into the stream (i.e., 80% of the YUK is removed by the soil).\nMethod 2 is a chemical treatment procedure which costs $1.50 per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) of wastewater treated. The chemical treatment has an efficiency of \\(e= 1 - 0.005X_2\\), where \\(X_2\\) is the quantity of wastewater (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)) treated. For example, if \\(X_2 = 50 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\), then \\(e = 1 - 0.005(50) = 0.75\\), so that 75% of the YUK is removed.\nCheap Plastic Products is wondering how to allocate their wastewater between these three disposal and treatment methods (land disposal, chemical treatment, and direct disposal) to meet the effluent standard while keeping costs manageable.\nThe flow of wastewater through this treatment system is shown in Figure 1. Modify the edge labels (by editing the edge_labels dictionary in the code producing Figure 1) to show how the wastewater allocations result in the final YUK discharge into Pristine Brook. For the edge_label dictionary, the tuple \\((i, j)\\) corresponds to the arrow going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The syntax for any entry is (i, j) =&gt; \"label text\", and the label text can include mathematical notation if the string is prefaced with an L, as in L\"x_1\" will produce \\(x_1\\).\n\nA = [0 1 1 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 0]\n\nnames = [\"Plant\", \"Land Treatment\", \"Chem Treatment\", \"Pristine Brook\"]\n# modify this dictionary to add labels\nedge_labels = Dict((1, 2) =&gt; \"\", (1,3) =&gt; \"\", (1, 4) =&gt; \"\",(2, 4) =&gt; \"\",(3, 4) =&gt; \"\")\nshapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]\nxpos = [0, -1.5, -0.25, 1]\nypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n\np = graphplot(A, names=names,edgelabel=edge_labels, markersize=0.15, markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)\ndisplay(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: System diagram of the wastewater treatment options in Problem 4.\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem:\n\nFormulate a mathematical model for the treatment cost and the amount of YUK that will be discharged into Pristine Brook based on the wastewater allocations. This is best done with some equations and supporting text explaining the derivation. Make sure you include, as additional equations in the model, any needed constraints on relevant values. You can find some basics on writing mathematical equations using the LaTeX typesetting syntax here, and a cheatsheet with LaTeX commands can be found on the course website’s Resources page.\nImplement your systems model as a Julia function which computes the resulting YUK concentration and cost for a particular treatment plan. You can return multiple values from a function with a tuple, as in:\nfunction multiple_return_values(x, y)\n    return (x+y, x*y)\nend\n\na, b = multiple_return_values(2, 5)\n@show a;\n@show b;\nTo evalute the function over vectors of inputs, you can broadcast the function by adding a decimal . before the function arguments and accessing the resulting values by writing a comprehension to loop over the individual outputs in the vector:\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\noutput = multiple_return_values.(x, y)\na = [out[1] for out in output]\nb = [out[2] for out in output]\n@show a;\n@show b;\nMake sure you comment your code appropriately to make it clear what is going on and why.\nUse your function to experiment with some different combinations of wastewater discharge and treatment and plot the results of these experiments. Can you find one that satisfies the YUK effluent standard (plot this as well as a dashed red line)? What was the cost? What can you say about the tradeoff between treatment cost and YUK concentration? You don’t have to find an “optimal” solution to this problem, but what do you think would be needed to find a better solution?\n\n\n\nProblem 5 (10 points)\nThis problem is only required for students in BEE 5750.\n\nProblem 5.1\nUsing a comprehension, count the number of odd numbers between 0 and 149.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\niseven() returns true for even numbers and false for odd numbers.\n\n\n\nProblem 5.2\nWrite a function polynomial(x, a) which calculates the polynomial \\[p(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x^i\\]\nbased on a point x and a coefficient vector a of length n using a loop. Test your function by computing \\[p(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 1\\] at \\(x=2\\).",

    "text": "Overview\nIn this lab, we will use Monte Carlo analysis to analyze a version of the culmination of every episode of the long-running game show The Price Is Right: the Showcase.\nMonte Carlo methods involve the simulation of random numbers from probability distributions. In an environmental context, we often propagate these random numbers through some more complicated model and then compute a resulting statistic which is relevant for assessing performance or risk, such as an average outcome or a particular quantile.\nYou should always start any computing with random numbers by setting a “seed,” which controls the sequence of numbers which are generated (since these are not really random, just “pseudorandom”). In Julia, we do this with the Random.seed!() function.\n\nRandom.seed!(1)\n\nTaskLocalRNG()\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter what seed you set, though different seeds might result in slightly different values. But setting a seed means every time your notebook is run, the answer will be the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeds and Reproducing Solutions\n\n\n\nIf you don’t re-run your code in the same order or if you re-run the same cell repeatedly, you will not get the same solution. If you’re working on a specific problem, you might want to re-use Random.seed() near any block of code you want to re-evaluate repeatedly.\n\n\n\nProbability Distributions and Julia\nJulia provides a common interface for probability distributions with the Distributions.jl package. The basic workflow for sampling from a distribution is:\n\nSet up the distribution. The specific syntax depends on the distribution and what parameters are required, but the general call is the similar. For a normal distribution or a uniform distribution, the syntax is\n# you don't have to name this \"normal_distribution\"\n# μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation\nnormal_distribution = Normal(μ, σ)\n# a is the upper bound and b is the lower bound; these can be set to +Inf or -Inf for an unbounded distribution in one or both directions.\nuniform_distribution = Uniform(a, b)\nThere are lots of both univariate and multivariate distributions, as well as the ability to create your own, but we won’t do anything too exotic here.\nDraw samples. This uses the rand() command (which, when used without a distribution, just samples uniformly from the interval \\([0, 1]\\).) For example, to sample from our normal distribution above:\n# draw n samples\nrand(normal_distribution, n)\n\nPutting this together, let’s say that we wanted to simulate 100 six-sided dice rolls. We could use a Discrete Uniform distribution.\n\ndice_dist = DiscreteUniform(1, 6) # can generate any integer between 1 and 6\ndice_rolls = rand(dice_dist, 100) # simulate rolls\n\n100-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 2\n 1\n 5\n 1\n 6\n 6\n 2\n 6\n 3\n ⋮\n 5\n 1\n 6\n 5\n 1\n 6\n 4\n 4\n 3\n\n\nAnd then we can plot a histogram of these rolls:\n\nhistogram(dice_rolls, legend=:false, bins=6)\nylabel!(\"Count\")\nxlabel!(\"Dice Value\")\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nRemember to:\n\nEvaluate all of your code cells, in order (using a Run All command). This will make sure all output is visible and that the code cells were evaluated in the correct order.\nTag each of the problems when you submit to Gradescope; a 10% penalty will be deducted if this is not done.",

    "text": "Exercise (3 Points)\nThe Showcase is the final round of every episode of The Price is Right, matching the two big winners from the episode. Each contestant is shown a “showcase” of prizes, which are usually some combination of a trip, a motor vehicle, some furniture, and maybe some other stuff. They then each have to make a bid on the retail price of the showcase. The rules are:\n\nan overbid is an automatic loss;\nthe contest who gets closest to the retail price wins their showcase;\nif a contestant gets within $250 of the retail price and is closer than their opponent, they win both showcases.\n\nYour goal is to find a wager which maximizes your expected winnings, which we may as well call utility, based on your assessment of the probability of your showcase retail price. Make the following assumptions about your expected winnings if you don’t overbid:\n\nIf you win both showcases, the value is the double of the single showcase value.\nIf you did not win both showcases but bid under the showcase value, the probability of being outbid increases linearly as the distance between your bid and the value increases (in other words, if you bid the exact value, you win with probability 1, and if you bid $0, you win with probability 0).\n\nWe’ll assume that the distribution of all showcases offered by the show is given as truncated normal distribution, which means a normal distribution which has an upper and/or lower bound. Distributions.jl makes it easy to specify truncations on any distribution, not just normal distributions. For example, we’ll use the distribution shown in Figure 1 for the showcase values (you can just directly use the showcase_dist distribution in your lab code).\n\nshowcase_dist = truncated(Normal(31000, 4500), lower=5000, upper=42000)\nshowcase_samples = rand(showcase_dist, 10_000)\nhistogram(showcase_samples)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of Showcase values for this lab, given as a truncated normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFind your expected winnings if you bid $35,000.

    "text": "Exercise (3 points)\nYour task is to decide how much lumber to produce to maximize profit from wood sales. You can purchase wood from a managed forest, which consists of spruce (320,000 bf) and fir (720,000 bf). Spruce costs \\(\\$0.12\\) per bf to purchase and fir costs \\(\\$0.08\\) per bf.\nAt the lumber mill, wood can be turned into plywood of various grades (see Table 1 for how much wood of each type is required for and the revenue from each grade). Any excess wood is sent to be recycled into particle board, which yields no revenue for the mill.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Wood inputs and revenue by plywood grade. S refers to spruce inputs, F fir inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlywood Grade\nInputs (bf/bf plywood)\nRevenue ($/1000 bf)\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.5 (S) + 1.5 (F)\n400\n\n\n2\n1.0 (S) + 2.0 (F)\n520\n\n\n3\n1.5 (S) + 2.0 (F)\n700\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to identify our decision variables. While there are several options, we will use \\(G_i\\), the amount of each grade the mill produces (in 1000 bf).\nUsing these decision variables, formulate a linear program to maximize the profit of the mill subject to the supply constraints on spruce and fir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuMP Syntax\n\n\n\nThe core pieces of setting up a JuMP model involve specifying the model and adding variables, the objective, and constraints. At the most simple level, this syntax looks like this:\nm = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n@variable(m, lb &lt;= x &lt;= ub) # if you do not have upper or lower bounds, you can drop those accordingly\n@variable(m, lb &lt;= y &lt;= ub)\n@objective(m, Max, 100x + 250y) # replace Max with Min depending on the problem\n@constraint(m, label, 6x + 12y &lt;= 80) # replace \"label\" with some meaningful string you would like to use later to query shadow prices, or drop it\nYou can add more constraints or more variables as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Array Syntax\n\n\n\nYou can set up multiple variables or constraints at once using array syntax. For example, the following are equivalent:\n@variable(m, G1 &gt;= 0)\n@variable(m, G2 &gt;= 0)\n@variable(m, G3 &gt;= 0)\nand\n@variable(m, G[1:3] &gt;= 0)\nYou can also set up multiple constraints using arrays of coefficients and/or bounds. For example:\nI = 1:3\nd = [0; 3; 5]\n@constraint(m, demand[i in I], G[i] &gt;= d[i])\n\n\nJuMP is finicky about changing objects and constraints, so I recommend setting up all of the model syntax in one notebook cell, which is what we will do here.\n\nforest_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer) # initialize model object\n@variable(forest_model, G[1:3] &gt;= 0) # non-negativity constraints\n# uncomment the following lines and add the objective and constraints as needed for the model\n# @objective(forest_model, )\n# @constraint(forest_model, )\nprint(forest_model) # this outputs a nicely formatted summary of the model so you can check your specification\n\nFeasibility\nSubject to\n G[1] ≥ 0\n G[2] ≥ 0\n G[3] ≥ 0\n\n\nNext, to optimize, use the optimize!() function:\n\noptimize!(forest_model)\n\nRunning HiGHS 1.7.2 (git hash: 5ce7a2753): Copyright (c) 2024 HiGHS under MIT licence terms\nCoefficient ranges:\n  Cost   [0e+00, 0e+00]\n  Bound  [0e+00, 0e+00]\nSolving LP without presolve, or with basis, or unconstrained\nSolving an unconstrained LP with 3 columns\nModel   status      : Optimal\nObjective value     :  0.0000000000e+00\nHiGHS run time      :          0.00\n\n\nYou should get confirmation that a solution was found; if one was not, there’s a chance something was wrong with your model formulation.\nTo find the values of the decision variables, use value() (which can be broadcasted over variable arrays):\n\n@show value.(G);\n\nvalue.(G) = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\nSimilarly, objective_value() finds the optimal value of the objective:\n\n@show objective_value(forest_model);\n\nobjective_value(forest_model) = 0.0\n\n\nFinally, we can find the dual values of the constraints with shadow_price(). Do this for the constraints in your model using the block below.\n\n# @show shadow_price(name_of_constraint);\n\nJuMP also lets you evaluate other expressions that you might be interested in based on the solutions. For example, you can use the following block to calculate the total amount of plywood the mill would produce under the optimal solution:\n\n@expression(forest_model, total_plywood, sum(G))\n@show value.(total_plywood);\n\nvalue.(total_plywood) = 0.0",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nJulia\nJulia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you’ve programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar.\nIf you have not successfully set up Julia, follow the instructions in Tools Setup and/or ask for help.\nYou can use other editors for this course, but our recommendation is Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension, which will make life a lot simpler! You should have set this up by following the Tools Setup instructions, but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of “cells”: code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\nClick once on this section of text. A box will appear around this text (and some areas above/below it) - all of that is within this cell.\nMarkdown is a text markup framework for formatting language that makes things look pretty when viewed across different platforms: web browsers, notebooks, and so forth. Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of the course website and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!). Here is a basic Markdown cheat sheet.\nWhat you are looking at right now is the formatted text after the Markdown is processed. To see the raw Markdown, do one of:\n\npress Enter while that cell is selected, or\ndouble-click on that cell.\n\n\nA couple of the features you will see in this Markdown cell:\n\nThe --- command creates a horizontal line. This is also nice for separating sections.\nBackticks (`...`) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\nThe # sign is used to create a new section header; two # signs (##) is used to create a new subsection header; ### creates a subsubsection, and so on.\nYou can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk * or a dash - and a space.\nYou can create regular text by just typing as usual.\nYou can create bold-faced text by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\nYou can create italicized text by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\nTo create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you’re probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type Shift + Enter to execute the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\nAdditionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\nOne tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n\nx = 5\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nwith\n\nx = 5\n\n5\n\n\n\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nIn Julia, you can also suppress the output of a command with a semi-colon:\n\nsin(x);\n\nwhich can help if you want to split some code out for clarity or to insert some text prior to it, but don’t want to clutter the notebook with its output.\nFor code cells, to execute the commands within the cell, we also press Shift+Enter.\nFinally, make sure that you evaluate all of the code cells in order before submitting. One bad outcome with notebooks occurs when cells are evaluated out of order, so fixed bugs and edits in previous cells do not get a chance to propagate down. You can do this with the Run All command in whichever interface you’re using to edit your notebook.\n\n\nJulia Basics\nThere are many tutorials and references for Julia, including a basics overview on the class website. Please feel free to reference these as you work through any part of the course.\n\n\nFormatting Math\nIt will often be helpful to include nicely-formatted mathematics in a notebook. Markdown accomodates this using LaTeX syntax. A LaTeX cheatsheet is available on the class website, and many other guides exist online.\nBelow is an example of a formatted equation: \\[x = 5.\\]\n\n\nLooking For Help\nThere is no shame in using Google, or other resources, for help when programming. There are many, many times when you can’t quite get the syntax to work, can’t quite figure out the right package or command to use, or are feeling too lazy or overwhelmed (I’m not judging either of those!) to dig through the documentation. Some good resources include:\n\nStack Overflow is a treasure trove of answers;\nThe official Julia forum and the Julia Subreddit are also very useful.\n\nYou are also highly encouraged to post on Ed Discussion, though getting a response might be less immediate. Just be mindful that to get good answers, you have to help people help you, and make sure to give credit to any resources that were helpful!",

As you are not required to submit your code, we will not be looking at it in detail, and instead will rely on those writeups to assess whether your approach is correct.\nIf using the notebook, evaluate all of your code cells, in order (using a Run All command). This will make sure all output is visible and that the code cells were evaluated in the correct order.\nTag each of the problems when you submit to Gradescope; a 10% penalty will be deducted if this is not done.\n\n\nComputing a Dot Product\nGiven two numeric arrays x and y, write a function to compute their dot product if they have equal length, and return an error if not (this is useful for debugging!). Use the following code as a starting point.\n\nfunction dot_product(x, y)\n    if ... # insert test condition for equal lengths\n        # compute and return dot product\n    else\n        throw(DimensionMismatch(\"length of x not equal to length of y\"))\n    end\nend\n\nHere are some tests to make sure your code works as intended. Tests like these are useful to make sure everything works as intended. One reason to split your code up into functions is that it makes it straightforward to write tests to make sure each piece of your code works, which makes it easier to identify where errors are occuring.\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6])\n\nIf you know the value you should get, you can write a more formal test using the @assert macro, which is a good way to “automate” checking (since you get an obvious error if the code doesn’t work as desired):\n\n@assert dot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6]) == 32\n\nLet’s also make sure we get an error when the dimensions of the two vectors don’t match:\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5])\n\n\n\nMaking a Plot\nWrite a function to compute the square of an integer x. Evaluate this function for integers between \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=5\\) and make a plot of the squared values (you can find a quick guide to making various types of plots here). Make sure to label your axes.\n\n# insert your code here",

The specific workflow for this will vary depending on how you’re writing up your solutions; please search for specifics and ask for help as needed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Commit Sizes\n\n\n\nIdeally, you’d commit whenever you make a “substantial” enough change that you want to lock in, such as writing the core code for a problem or completing a problem, if you’re preparing code to be used elsewhere (by yourself or others), or if you want to ask for help. git lets you revert changes back to a previous commit, so it’s easy to undo changes or updates which broke something that was previously working, so changing too many things at once can make it hard to keep track of what worked when.\nBut in this case, go ahead and just commit after finishing the problems.\n\n\nPush the repository with these commits to GitHub and take a screenshot of the repository page (https://github.com/BEE4750-FA24/&lt;username&gt;/lab01) which shows the updated repository.

The farmer has asked you for advice on how they should plant crops and apply pesticides to maximize profits over 130 total ha while remaining in regulatory compliance if demand for each crop (which is the maximum the market would buy) this year is 250,000 kg?\nIn this problem:\n\nFormulate a linear program for this resource allocation problem, including clear definitions of decision variable(s) (including units), objective function(s), and constraint(s) (make sure to explain functions and constraints with any needed derivations and explanations). Tip: Make sure that all of your constraints are linear.\nImplement the program in JuMP.jl and find the solution.

Discuss why this value makes sense and whether you would recommend the farmer should make the purchase.\n\n\n\nProblem 2 (30 points)\nFor this problem, we will use hourly load (demand) data from 2013 in New York’s Zone C (which includes Ithaca).

The utility can build any of the following plant types: geothermal, coal, natural gas combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), natural gas combustion turbine (CT), solar, and wind.\nWhile coal, CCGT, and CT plants can generate at their full installed capacity, geothermal plants operate at maximum 85% capacity, and solar and wind available capacities vary by the hour depend on the expected meteorology. The utility will also penalize any non-served demand at a rate of $10,000/MWh.\nIn this problem:\n\nFormulate a linear program for this capacity expansion problem, including clear definitions of decision variable(s) (including units), objective function(s), and constraint(s) (make sure to explain functions and constraints with any needed derivations and explanations).\nImplement your linear program in JuMP.jl. Find the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What will the total cost be? How much energy will be non-served?\nWhat fraction of annual generation does each plant type produce? How does this compare to the breakdown of built capacity that you found in Problem 1.5? Do these results make sense given the generator data?\nMake a plot of the electricity price in each hour. Discuss any trends that you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant Digits\n\n\n\nUse round(x; digits=n) to report values to the appropriate precision! If your number is on a different order of magnitude and you want to round to a certain number of significant digits, you can use round(x; sigdigits=n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Variable Output Values\n\n\n\nvalue.(x) will report the values of a JuMP variable x, but it will return a special container which holds other information about x that is useful for JuMP. This means that you can’t use this output directly for further calculations. To just extract the values, use value.(x).data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppressing Model Command Output\n\n\n\nThe output of specifying model components (variable or constraints) can be quite large for this problem because of the number of time periods. If you end a cell with an @variable or @constraint command, I highly recommend suppressing output by adding a semi-colon after the last command, or you might find that your notebook crashes.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3 (10 points)\nThis problem is only required for students in BEE 5750.\nThe NY state legislature is considering enacting an annual CO2 limit, which for the utility would limit the emissions in its footprint to 1.5 MtCO2/yr.\nIn this problem:\n\nReformulate your linear program from Problem 2 with any necessary changes to capture the CO2 limit.\nImplement the new optimization problem and find the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What is different from your plan from Problem 1? Do these changes make sense?\nWhat would the value to the utility be of allowing it to emit an additional 1000 tCO2/yr? An additional 5000?",

    "text": "What Homework Is For\nThis class involves two components which are somewhat in tension pedagogically:\n\nConceptual what are systems, how do they behave, what are methods for their analysis and why do we use them;\nComputational how to implement systems analysis methods.\n\nOut of these, we are more interested in the conceptual: the computational methods are a means to an end. What matters more is the act of translating an environmental system into an appropriate mathematical model and interpreting the results of that model to provide insights into the design and management of the system. Getting better at that act requires practice: this is what homework is for! It’s easy to nod and follow along in lecture, or read a derivation, but that’s a trap. You can only learn by doing, and often, failing.\nHomework is the opportunity to practice doing. The practice is more important than the solution, which is why the solution is the least “rewarded” part of the homework rubrics. You can only learn by trying to solve the problem, and, often, getting stuck, because these are new skills that you are developing. And that’s ok — we encourage you to collaborate so you can share ideas and suggestions and give feedback, not to get solutions (and that’s also true for office hours, TA sessions, etc).\nYou also may not even be able to tell what parts of your homework solution are correct. And that’s also ok! We grade your homework and give you homework solutions so you can identify what, if anything, went wrong, and how to do better next time. We always aim for improvement, not perfection, and every homework problem is an opportunity to practice doing that type of problem.\nBut this emphasis on homework as practice also means that you should start the homework early. If you start early, and get stuck, you have the opportunity to get yourself unstuck, either by banging your head against the problem or by talking to others, and that’s how you learn. If you start late and get stuck, you either have to not finish (not great) or cheat (unacceptable under any circumstances).",

    "text": "Homework Logistics\n\nAccepting Assignments\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed through GitHub Classroom. When an assignment is released, a link to accept the assignment will be posted on Ed Discussion. You must click this link or subsequent steps will not work properly. Clicking this link will create your own repository with the files for the assignment. The first time you do this, you will be prompted to connect your GitHub username with your entry in the class roster.\nClone your repository to your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important that you clone the repository created in the previous step, not the “original” repository. Make sure that the URL looks like https://www.github.com/BEE4750-FA24/&lt;username&gt;-hwxx.git, not https://www.github.com/BEE4750/hwxx.git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking On Assignments\n\nOpen the local repository folder you created when you cloned the remote repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse File -&gt; Open Folder rather than File -&gt; Open to open the folder; this will make sure that all paths point to the right location and you can use the “Explorer” to see the different files.\n\n\n\nAfter the notebook loads, if prompted to, select the julia-1.10 kernel.\nMake sure that you run the initial notebook cell (starting with Pkg.activate()) to load the Julia environment and install any needed packages.\nYou don’t need to work in the notebook, per se, but if you choose to write your own code files, make sure to add them to the repository with git add. Make sure that you copy the initial notebook cell into your new script(s) to use the appropriate environment.\nAs you work on assignments, make sure to save and frequently push and commit back to GitHub.\nYou can toggle line numbers in a notebook cell with the L key.\n\n\n\nAsking for Assistance\n\nIf you need to share code to ask for help or to provide help, provide a link to the relevant file in your GitHub repository, along with an idea of the relevant cell and line number(s).\nMinimal code snippets can also be copied and pasted into Ed, but these should be self-contained, not chunks copied from your homework. These snippets should illustrate what you think the correct concept and/or syntax should be with a self-contained example; it’s unlikely you will receive useful help if the snippet can’t be evaluated.\nMake sure you document what you’ve tried (including any searches) so we can focus on new solutions, not repeating things that haven’t already worked. If you haven’t looked for help (e.g. searching for an error message), start there.\n\n\n\nSubmitting Assignments\n\nYour final submission must be in a PDF. You can generate this in several ways:\n\nIf you have set up LaTeX on your system, you can convert a notebook directly to PDF in VS Code or Jupyter Lab (this will automatically work on BioHPC without any additional setup);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are submitting a PDF from a notebook, make sure that you evaluate all cells in order with Run Cells before converting.\n\n\n\nIf you have not set up LaTeX, you can export a notebook to HTML and save it from your browser as a PDF;\nIf you have written a report outside of a notebook (e.g. in Word), save this to a PDF.\n\nYou do not need to include code in a written submission, but make sure your final notebook and/or scripts are on your GitHub repository in case there’s an issue.\nPDFs must be submitted by the due date and time to Gradescope with pages tagged. Failure to tag pages will receive a 10% deduction.\nIf you did not receive credit for your group’s submission, please have someone in your group use a regrade request to bring this to our attention, and we will use the list of names at the top of the page to confirm that you contributed to the assignment.\nLate submissions are accepted within 24 hours with a 50% penalty unless an extension was arranged ahead of the original deadline.",

    "section": "How To Write Assignments",
    "text": "How To Write Assignments\nHere are some tips for how to make the grader (the TA or Prof. Srikrishnan) understand what you mean in the time they’re looking at your problem: as noted in the rubrics, if your solution isn’t clear enough for us to follow, you will not receive the points even if your answer is technically correct, because part of demonstrating understanding is the ability to organize and communicate.\n\nBe Honest\n\nWrite everything in your own words. It’s perfectly ok to work with others; in fact, we encourage it! But you should write up and implement everything yourself; it’s very easy to convince yourself that you understand something when you’re mimicking someone else’s solution, and often we realize we don’t actually understand something when we try to write it ourselves.\nCite every outside source you use. You are allowed, in fact encouraged, to use any outside source1 Getting an idea from an outside source is not a problem, and will not lower your grade; if you’re critically evaluating the idea and implementing and writing your solution yourself (see above), then you’re demonstrating understanding even if the idea originated with someone else. But you must give appropriate credit to that source. Taking credit for someone else’s ideas and failing to properly cite an outside source, including your classmates, is plagiarism, and will be treated accordingly.\nThe only sources you do not have to cite are official class materials. If you use the lectures, lecture notes, website materials, homework solutions, etc, you do not have to cite these.\nList everyone that you worked with. Give your classmates proper credit for their assistance. If you get an idea from Ed Discussion, credit the poster. If you’re not sure if you should list someone as a collaborator, err on the side of including them. For discussions in class or in office hours, you don’t have to list everyone who participated in the discussion (though you should if you worked one on one with them), but mention that the class discussion or the office hour was useful.\n\n1 Yes, including ChatGPT, though you should ask and describe how you used it.\n\nBe Clear\n\nWrite legibly. This doesn’t refer to handwriting (since you’ll be submitting PDFs of Jupyter notebooks), but the text itself should be clearly written and well organized, so that it’s easy for the grader to follow your reasoning or explanation. Structuring your solution, and not writing in a stream of consciousness, helps you think more clearly. To reiterate: You will be given no points if the grader cannot easily follow your answer, and the graders have complete discretion to determine this.\nWrite clearly. Use proper spelling, grammar, logic, etc. We will try not to penalize people for not having complete mastery of English, but again, we need to be able to follow your reasoning.\nWrite carefully and completely. We can only grade what you write; nobody can read your mind, and we will not try. The solution that you submit must stand on its own. If your answer is ambiguous, the TA has been instructed to interpret it the wrong way. Regrade requests also cannot be used to add more information to a solution.\nDon’t submit your first draft. For most people, first drafts are terrible. They are often poorly organized, unclear, and contain gaps or jumps in reasoning. You will likely need to revise, possibly several times, for your answer to be clear, careful, and complete. This is another reason to start the assignment early — if you start late, you may be stuck with your first draft, and your grade is likely to suffer for it.\nState your assumptions. If you think a problem statement is ambiguous and your solution depends on a particular interpretation, or you need to make some assumptions to solve the problem, make it explicit (though do also ask for clarification in class or on Ed Discussion).\nDon’t rely on your code. The TA will not try to scrutinize your code, which is a waste of time (again, the code is a means to an end — it works or it doesn’t). If you make it clear what your code is supposed to do with a description, then the TA can tell if this logic is correct and any mistake must be something minor in the code. If you just provide code (even if commented), the TA can’t do this without running your code and debugging, which is not a valuable use of time. We want to focus on your ideas.",

The black line is the P recycling level (for \\(q=2.5\\)), which adds P back into the lake, and the dashed lines correspond to differerent rates of P outflow (based on the linear parameter \\(b\\)). The lake P level is in equilibrium when the recycling rate equals the outflows. When the outflow is greater than the recycling flux, the lake’s P level decreases, and when the recycling flux is greater than the outflow, the P level naturally increases. The red lines show the direction of this net flux."

The large mass of plants and algae have several noxious effects on the ecosystem, including:\n\nhypoxia (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to “dead zones”;\nacidification (from the CO2 produced by decomposition);\nreduced sunlight (from an accumulation of surface algae);\nclogged water intakes; and\nreduction in recreational value and drinking water quality.\n\nIn lakes, eutrophication is often caused by excess input of nutrients (particularly phosphorous, P), which can come from point sources (such as industrial processes) and/or non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff). As the P releases are related to economic activity, we can view this (simplified) lake management problem from the perspective of a tradeoff between economic benefits and the health of the lake: while there are benefits to the activities which lead to P releases, there are recreational, aesthetic, and ecological benefits to maintaining the lake in a non-eutrophic (or oligotrophic) state.\n\n\nModel Formulation\nSuppose we have a town which emits phosphorous into a lake as a by-product of economic activity. The level of P in the lake at a given time \\(t\\) is given by \\(X_t\\) (for the purposes of this problem, we will just treat all values as dimensionless).\nThe level of controllable P release in year \\(t\\) is \\(a_t\\). The lake also receives random levels of phosphorous from non-point source runoff, which we denote by \\(y_t\\). We model these random runoffs using a lognormal distribution \\(LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), which ensures that the runoffs cannot be negative.\nThere is also some nutrient cycling in the lake which naturally reduces phosphorous concentrations. This cycling is the result of accumulation in the sediment and turnover (water motion disturbing the sediment and carrying the nutrients upwards) and consumers, such as mussels. This cycling is dependent on the state \\(X_t\\), \\(\\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q}\\). The lake also loses some of its P each time period of its due to outflows and consumption, which we assume is linearly proportional to the state, \\(bX_t\\).\n\n\n\nShallow Lake Problem Diagram\n\n\nAs a result, the lake dynamics are given by:\n\\[X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\quad y_t \\sim LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\]\nwhere parameter interpretation is given in the table below.\n\nLake problem parameters\n\n\nParameter\nDefinition\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_t\\)\nP concentration in lake\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(a_t\\)\npoint source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(y_t\\)\nnon-point source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(q\\)\nP recycling rate\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(b\\)\nrate at which P is lost\ndimensionless"

The black line is the P recycling level (for $q=2.5), which adds P back into the lake, and the dashed lines correspond to differerent rates of P outflow (based on the linear parameter \\(b\\)). The lake P level is in equilibrium when the recycling rate equals the outflows. When the outflow is greater than the recycling flux, the lake’s P level decreases, and when the recycling flux is greater than the outflow, the P level naturally increases. The red lines show the direction of this net flux.\n\n\n\n\nBased on Figure 1, we can see that there are typically three equilibria: a stable equilibrium at \\(X=0\\), an unstable, oligotrophic equilibrium \\(X_o\\), and a stable, eutrophic equilibrium \\(X_e\\). When \\(X_t &lt; X_o\\), the lake tends towards a zero P level without external inputs, while when \\(X_t &gt; X_o\\), the lake will inevitably undergo eutrophication, as the P level will tend towards \\(X_e\\). This means that \\(X_t=X_o\\) corresponds to a tipping point: beyond that level, the lake will abruptly switch to a eutrophic state from which it cannot recover.\nThis lake is subject to a bifurcation depending on the values of \\(b\\) and \\(q\\). To see this, let’s fix \\(q=2.5\\), as in Figure 1. For \\(b=0.4\\), there are the two equilibria mentioned previously. However, when \\(b=0.2\\), there is only the unstable equilibrium \\(X=X_o\\) in addition to \\(X=0\\). For \\(b=0.6\\), the only equilibrium is \\(X=0\\), so any positive P input would result in eutrophication. This highlights the delicacy of systems which exhibit bifurcations: whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable, or even exists, can depend on a characteristic of the system which is often highly uncertain.\n\neq = [0, 0.67, 2.2]\nscatter!(p1, eq, (y -&gt; lake_P_cycling(y, 2.5)).(eq), label=\"Equilibria\", markersize=10, markercolor=:red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lake eutrophication dynamics based on the shallow lake modelwithout additional inputs.

We will use positive grading (points awarded for each component).\nEach standard rubric describes partial credit for a problem with 10 points. Partial credit for (sub)problems worth less than 10 points should be scaled appropriately. Full problems usually combine one of the modeling methods with some interpretation questions, so the rubric will be a combination of the individual components.\nGenerally, rubrics for 10 point “entire problems” can be summarized with the following:\n\n+4 points for an answer with a correct implementation (including model setup).\n+2 points for the correct solution (including details such as labels, units, etc.).\n+4 points for the interpretation. These points may be broken up across subproblems, but the general assignment of points should follow this summary.\n\nNote that the points may not scale with the distribution of work for a given problem. That’s life! It may take more work to derive and implement your model than it does to intrepret your results, but in this class we care a lot about your ability to critically evaluate and interpret modeling results.\nSometimes problems will be broken up into\nThe graders cannot read your mind and will not try to. Submissions that are unclear for any reason, including but not limited to unclear syntax (English or code), uncommented code, lack of reasoning or derivation, too much detail or writing, will not be given credit. The TA has complete discretion here. If something in your solution is ambiguous, the TA has been instructed to interpret it the “wrong” way. Clear responses are a sign of understanding, which is part of what we’re assessing.\nYou will not be doubly penalized for getting the “right” solution to the “wrong” setup (you would have been penalized above), but this requires the TA to be able to easily identify that your implementation is correct given the wrong model. If your implementation is unclear, you are likely to lose points here because we have no way of knowing that your answer is “right” without re-coding your problem.\nYou will not be given credit for your code (this isn’t a programming class); the code is a means to solving the problem, and we’re more interested in how you set up the problem and interpret the solution. This does mean that code that is sloppy but works is perfectly acceptable. However, your code may get you partial credit if the TA can easily find where you made a mistake, so make sure your submitted code is well commented. It’s important to write down the mathematics of what your code is trying to implement, because the TA will only take a cursory look at your code.\nSome rubrics include “deadly sins” which will cause an immediate zero to be given for the problem.

    "text": "Data Types\nEach datum (importantly, not the variable which is bound to it) has a data type. Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int. One way to force an Int variable to be a Float is to add a decimal point at the end of the integer.\n\ntypeof(9.)\n\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings hold characters, rather than numeric values.

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any)\n\u001b[0m\u001b[90m   @\u001b[39m \u001b[32mMain\u001b[39m \u001b[90m\u001b[4mIn[50]:1\u001b[24m\u001b[39m\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42",

For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x &gt;= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x &gt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x &lt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9",

Solvers are also not typically universal, as different types of optimization problems use different algorithms, so be aware of what problem you’re trying to solve instead of just blindly copying code from one task to another.\nFor example, for the linear programming example, we will use the HiGHS solver via the HiGHS.jl package. As seen on the solver table, HiGHS is open source (via the MIT license) and can solve linear programs (LP) and mixed-integer linear programs (MILP), as well as quadratic programs (which we won’t discuss in this course).",

    "text": "Linear Programming Example: How Many Widgets Should A Factory Produce?\n\nDefining The Problem\nSuppose we own a factory that can produce two types of widgets:\n\nWidget A generates a profit of \\(p_A = \\$100\\) per widget; and\nWidget B generates a profit of \\(p_B = \\$75\\) per widget.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of units of widget A that we want to produce, and \\(y\\) the number of units of widget B. Our goal is to maximize our total profit \\(p_Ax + p_By\\). This is the objective function. We express this objective using the equation \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\max_{x, y} 100x + 75y. \\label{eq:objective}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis isn’t a very interesting problem yet! We would simply build as much of both widgets as we could, because there are no constraints on our ability to produce. To make this more realistic, let’s suppose that both widgets are produced using the same raw material \\(M\\), of which we can only procure 300 units. Then, if:\n\nWidget A requires 40 units of \\(M\\) per widget, and\nWidget B requires 20 units of \\(M\\) per widget, we arrive at the following material constraint: \\[\\begin{equation}\n40x + 20y \\leq 300. \\label{eq:constraint1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nBut we might have another constraint: time! Each widget may take a different amount of labor to produce. For example, let’s say that\n\nWidget A takes 6 hours to produce and\nWidget B takes 12 hours to produce. Further, there are only 80 hours per work that can be allocated to widget production. This becomes the time constraint \\[\\begin{equation}\n6x + 12y \\leq 80. \\label{eq:constraint2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nFinally, we cannot build a negative number of either type of widget. This is known as a non-negativity constraint, and can be expressed as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constraintx} \\\\\ny &\\geq 0 \\label{eq:constrainty}\n\\end{align}\\]\nConsolidating equations \\(\\eqref{eq:objective}\\)–\\(\\eqref{eq:constrainty}\\) gives us the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max_{x, y} & 100x + 75y\\\\\n&\\text{subject to} & \\\\\n& & 40x + 20y \\leq 300\\\\\n& & 6x + 12y \\leq 80\\\\\n& & x \\geq 0\\\\\n& & y \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned} \\label{eq:widget}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nVisualizing the Problem\nLet’s do some plotting to examine the geometry of our optimization problem. We can do this using the Plots.jl package in Julia.\n\n## set up objective function parameters and variables\npa = 100\npb = 75\na = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\nb = range(0, 8, step=0.25)\n\n## define objective function\nf(a, b) = pa * a + pb * b\n\n## start plotting\ncontour(a,b,(a,b)-&gt;f(a,b),nlevels=15, c=:heat, linewidth=10, colorbar = false, contour_labels = true) # objective function contours\ntitle!(\"Factory Optimization Problem\") # add title\nxaxis!(\"x=Widget A\", lims=(0, maximum(a))) # add x-axis title and limits\nyaxis!(\"y=Widget B\", lims=(0, maximum(b))) # add y-axis title and limits\nxticks!(0:maximum(a)) # set x-axis ticks\nyticks!(0:maximum(b)) # set y-axis ticks\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=11], (300 .- 40*a)./20, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot materials constraint feasible region\nareaplot!(a[a.&lt;=8], (80 .- 6*a)./12, legend=false, opacity=0.3) # plot time constraint feasible region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Decision space for the widget linear program \\(\\eqref{eq:widget}\\).

    "section": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP",
    "text": "Solving This Problem Using JuMP\n\nSetting Up the Model and Solver\nTo solve our problem, first we need to define the model. The model object has lots of attributes, including the variables, constraints, solver options, etc. We create a new model using the Model() function. Since we are using the HiGHS solver, we need to tell JuMP to use the HiGHS.Optimizer solver function.\n\nfactory_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer) \n\nThere are a bunch of attributes and options that we could set, but we won’t in this example. If needed, look at the HiGHS.jl documentation.\n\nDefine Variables\nDecision variables (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this case) in JuMP are defined using the @variable macro. The first argument passed to @variable() is the model object, in this case, factory_model, and the second argument are bounds on that variable, created using &gt;= and &lt;=. JuMP will interpret the bound specification to obtain the variable name. In this case, our only bounds directly on the variables are the non-negativity constraints.\n\n@variable(factory_model, x &gt;= 0)\n@variable(factory_model, y &gt;= 0)\n\nIf we had a free (or unbounded) variable \\(z\\), we could declare that variable using @variable(model, z). JuMP also requires unique names for each variable, or it will throw an error. This is one place where it’s nice that Julia lets us use sub- and superscripts in variable names!\nIf we did want to modify the bounds after defining the variable, we could do so using the set_lower_bound and set_upper_bound functions, or we could remove them using delete_lower_bound and delete_upper_bound.\nFinally, if we want to see all of the variables associated with a model, we can use the all_variables function to obtain an array.\n\nall_variables(factory_model)\n\n2-element Vector{VariableRef}:\n x\n y\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Constraints\nWhen defining variables, we were able to declare constraints on their values by specifying upper and lower bounds. However, we also have other constraints, which involve multiple decision variables. These are specified using the @constraint macro. Unlike variables, we also need to pass names for each constraint. We will use time for the time constraint and materials for the materials constraint. These names must be unique.\n\n@constraint(factory_model, time, 6x + 12y &lt;= 80) # specify the time constraint\n@constraint(factory_model, materials, 40x + 20y &lt;= 300) # materials constraint\n\n\n\nDefine Objective Function\nSo far, we’ve defined the feasible region of the decision-variable domain by setting the constraints. But we need to specify our objective function to know what we are trying to minimize or maximize over this region. We define the objective function using the @objective macro. In addition to specifying the model objective and the function, we need to tell JuMP whether we want to minimize or maximize.\n\n@objective(factory_model, Max, 100x + 75y)\n\n\n\nLooking At The Full Model\nNow, let’s look at the model specification. print() will print out a formatted version of the model; in a notebook (or on this page), that will be marked up with LaTeX, in a REPL terminal, it will not be.\n\nprint(factory_model)\n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\max\\quad & 100 x + 75 y\\\\\n\\text{Subject to} \\quad & 6 x + 12 y \\leq 80\\\\\n& 40 x + 20 y \\leq 300\\\\\n& x \\geq 0\\\\\n& y \\geq 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nIf you want a LaTeX-marked up version in the REPL, use latex_formulation().\nWe won’t go into detail here, but there are other ways to define the model, which are detailed in the JuMP documentation. For example, we can specify multiple variables using @variables. Similarly, we can use @constraints to define multiple constraints at once. Or we can use loops to define multiple constraints or constraints involving many variables. We can also specify the model in vectorized syntax, which is similar to how linear programs are specified in MATLAB.\n\n\nSolve the Model\nNow it’s time to solve the model and find the optimal values \\((x^*, y^*)\\). Since we specified the solver when we initialized factory_model, all we have to do is call the optimize! function.\n\noptimize!(factory_model)\n\nRunning HiGHS 1.5.3 [date: 1970-01-01, git hash: 45a127b78]\nCopyright (c) 2023 HiGHS under MIT licence terms\nPresolving model\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\n2 rows, 2 cols, 4 nonzeros\nPresolve : Reductions: rows 2(-0); columns 2(-0); elements 4(-0) - Not reduced\nProblem not reduced by presolve: solving the LP\nUsing EKK dual simplex solver - serial\n  Iteration        Objective     Infeasibilities num(sum)\n          0    -1.0937489944e+01 Ph1: 2(4.125); Du: 2(10.9375) 0s\n          2     8.4722222222e+02 Pr: 0(0) 0s\nModel   status      : Optimal\nSimplex   iterations: 2\nObjective value     :  8.4722222222e+02\nHiGHS run time      :          0.01\n\n\n\n\nQuery the Solution\nTo find the optimal values of our decision variables, we need to query the values of the variables using value.(). We use value.() (the vectorized version of value()) because JuMP stores decision variables differently depending on their number and how they were defined.

As engineers, our work touches on many critical aspects of society, and questions of inclusion and social justice cannot be separated from considerations of systems analysis, objective selection, risk analysis, and trade-offs.\nIn all communications and interactions with each other, members of this class community (students and instructors) are expected to be respectful and inclusive. In this spirit, we ask all participants to:\n\nshare their experiences, values, and beliefs;\nbe open to and respectful of the views of others; and\nvalue each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.\n\nPlease let me know if you feel any aspect(s) of class could be made more inclusive. Please also share any preferred name(s) and/or your pronouns with me if you wish: I use he/him/his, and you can refer to me either as Vivek or Prof. Srikrishnan.\nPlease be professional and courteous on all course interactions and platforms, and (except in designated off-topic boards or forums) please keep all online discussion relevant to the course. We do not anticipate this as a problem given our experience; almost all students in almost all classes meet these expectations. However, even a single incident can do serious damage to the learning environment and the well-being of your fellow students.\nSexually explicit, harassing, threatening, bullying, trolling, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise grossly unprofessional content will be removed. Anyone behaving in these fashions or posting such content will be blocked/banned from the appropriate platform and may be given an F if they are consistently disruptive.\nWe have configured our Ed Discussion board to allow anonymous posts; we will restrict posts to real names only if anyonmous posts become problematic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them.

If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed. Emergency announcements will also be made on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Tips\n\n\n\n\nDo not take screenshots of code. I will not respond. Screenshots can be difficult to read and limit accessibility. Put your code on GitHub, share the link, and point to specific line numbers if relevant, or provide a simple, self-contained example of the problem you’re running into.\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Ed, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nIf you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health And This Class\n\n\n\nI am not a trained counselor, but I am here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to me, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential.",

This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nMask Policies\nPlease stay home and rest if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or any other respiratory illness. No masking will be required, but please be respectful of others who may wear masks or take other precautions to avoid illness. This policy may change if there is another outbreak of COVID-19 (or other illness), but will be kept consistent with broader Cornell mask policies.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\n\n\n\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, for any purpose whatsoever, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Large Language Models Useful For?\n\n\n\nChatGPT and other large-language models can predictively generate text, but note that there is no idea underlying its prediction model (it is purely statistical). You should therefore think about it as a glorified and stochastic Google search, albeit one which synthesizes the material for you, so you can’t access or understand its judgement or reasoning.\nAs a result, simply submitting ChatGPT output is likely to get you zero credit for any analysis or interpretation questions, and may be less helpful than you think for questions about derivations or model setups. Where ChatGPT can be helpful is in starting or debugging code (particularly interpreting error messages), especially if you’re unsure about syntax. However, in our experience, the interpretations and solutions from ChatGPT may often also just be wrong due to the LLM drawing from sufficiently different code examples users have provided in other forums; you’ll still need to exercise judgement and figure out if what ChatGPT output works or makes sense to ensure credit. You’d be surprised — careful use of LLMs does not actually save very much time!\n\n\nIf approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work can be submitted up to 24 hours late at a 50% penalty, and will not be accepted after that point. This policy may seem strict, but allows for prompt release of solutions and discussion of assignments. Please reach out as soon as possible (ideally before the due date) if legitimate circumstances emerge which prevent you from submitting work within 24 hours of the due date; we will make accomodations for approved reasons, which might included a limited extension or dropping the assignment.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests can be submitted up to one week after the graded work is released on Gradescope.\nAll regrade requests must include a brief justification for the request or they will not be considered. Good justifications include (but are not limited to): - My answer agrees with the posted solution, but I still lost points. - I lost 4 points for something, but the rubric says it should only be worth 2 points. - You took points off for something, but it’s right here. - My answer is correct, even though it does not match the posted solution; here is an explanation. - There is no explanation for my grade. - I got a perfect score, but my solution has a mistake (you will receive extra credit for this! see below!) - There is a major error in the posted solution; here is an explanation (full credit for everyone, but Prof. Srikrishnan will decide what constitutes a “major error”! see below!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Can Only Grade What You Submitted\n\n\n\nAll regrades will be assessed based only on the submitted work. You cannot get a higher grade by explanating what you meant (either in person or online) or by adding information or reasoning to what is submitted after the fact. The goal of the regrade is to draw attention to a potential grading problem, not to supplement the submission.\n\n\nThe first regrade request for any submission will be handled by the person who graded that homework problem. The first regrade request for any exam submission will be handled by whoever graded that exam problem. If the submission was graded by the TA, additional regrade requests for the same submission will be handled directly by the instructor. Once Prof. Srikrishnan issues a final response to a regrade request, further requests for that submission will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegrade Requests Can Be A Gamble!\n\n\n\nWhile you should submit regrade requests for legitimate errors, using them for fishing expeditions can also result in lost points if the TA or Prof. Srikrishnan decide that your initial grade was too lenient or if additional errors are identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I Find A Different Type of Mistake?\n\n\n\n\nIf you submit a regrade request correctly reporting that a problem was graded too leniently — that is, that your score was higher than it should be based on the rubric — your score will be increased by the difference. For example, if your original score on a problem was 8/10 and you successfully argue that your score should have been 3/10, your new score will be 13/10. However, don’t fish — your grade might be lowered if the TA finds an independent mistake while regrading.\nIf a significant error is discovered in a posted homework solution or in the exam solutions, everyone will in the class will receive full credit for the (sub)problem. Prof. Srikrishnan will decide what is “significant”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\nOffice hours with both Prof. Srikrishnan and the TA will be available each week at times specified at the top of this syllabus. Changes to the office hour schedule (cancellations/rescheduling) will be announced in class and on Ed Discussion.\nOffice hours are intended to help all students who attend. This time is limited, and is best spent on issues that are relevant to as many students as possible. While we will do our best to answer individual questions, students asking us to verify or debug homework solutions or help with syntax will have the lowest priority (but please do ask about how to verify or debug your own solutions!). However, we are happy to discuss conceptual approaches to solving homework problems, which may help to reveal bugs.\nSpace at office hours can be limited (we may shift to the conference room in 316 Riley-Robb if offices are full and it is available). If the room is crowded and you can find an alternative source of assistance, or if your question is low priority (e.g. debugging) please be kind and make room for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I Can’t Make Office Hours?\n\n\n\nWhile we will try to select office hours that work for as much of the class as possible, both the course staff and students have busy schedules and no time will work for everyone. If you need help outside of office hours (e.g. office hours do not fit your schedule), please send an email to the TA or Prof. Srikrishnan as soon as possible. These requests may not be accepted on short notice (e.g. if you have a question about a homework due on Friday and send a request on Thursday; schedules for course staff may already be full). We recommend starting your homework promptly so you can take advantage of office hours or make an appointment over a longer period.",

    "text": "Assessments\nYour grade will be computed as the weighted average of the following assessment categories:\n\n\n\nCategory\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\n10%\n\n\nExercises\n10%\n\n\nLabs\n10%\n\n\nHomework\n20%\n\n\nPrelims\n30%\n\n\nTerm Project\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill There Be a Curve?\n\n\n\nGrades on individual assessments will not be curved. It is unlikely that the final grades will be adjusted, but we may apply a curve if and only if circumstances arise which would make this appropriate, such as if the exams turn out to be longer or more difficult than intended. Grades will not be curved to meet any pre-defined distribution; it is entirely possible that everyone earns an A or everyone earns an F. Asking about a curve will not make one more likely.\n\n\n\nParticipation\nParticipating fully in the class allows you to gain more from the class and contribute more to the learning of your classmates. Some ways to participate include:\n\nAsking questions in class or on Ed;\nAnswering questions in class or on Ed;\nActively engaging in in-class activities;\nComing to office hours.\n\nNote that just passively attending class will not yield full participation points. Participation points are not free: you are likely to lose points if you consistently skip class or do not ask or answer questions online or in person. At the end of the term, you will be asked to evaluate your own participation over the course of the semester, in addition to my documentation of your participation.\n\n\nExercises\nMost weeks will involve a short problem set aimed at assessing key concepts. We will use Canvas for these exercises. These will be released Monday at the start of class and are due before class (2:55PM) the following Monday. The exercises will be multiple choice or similar (categorization, multiple answer, etc), automatically graded, and you can submit them as often as you like. It is highly recommended that you do these promptly and take them seriously, as concepts and simple code practice will be useful for the homeworks and midterm exams. We will automatically drop one exercise set, but no late exercises will be accepted.\n\n\nLabs\nApproximately 5 class periods will be dedicated to working through simple examples to guide you through applying concepts and methods from class. Students should bring their laptops to class, and will be given a worksheet to complete (as much as they can) during these lab classes. Labs will be designed to be completed in class, though you may occasionally require additional time; however, lab worksheets must be submitted by 9:00pm on the lab day. As a result, I encourage you to make sure that you download and set up the lab materials ahead of time; these will be provided for you on Ed Discussion. Labs will be graded on a scale of 0-3 on the basis of effort towards demonstrated work, rather than absolute correctness or completion. No labs will be dropped by default. If you cannot bring a laptop to class, you can work with other students, though you must turn in your own worksheet for grading.\n\n\nHomework Assignments\nApproximately 5 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester, one per course module (plus an initial homework to build or refresh programming and debugging skills). The homework assignments are more in-depth problem sets involving the modeling (derivation and implementation) and analysis of one or more environmental systems problems.\nYou will generally have two class weeks to work on an assignment. This is intended to provide you enough time to work on the problem and debug and evaluate your code (including troubleshooting any technical problems); these are not reasons for late submission. Each homework assignment will build on material from the prior classes and possibly from the day the homework is assigned.\nStudents are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, and groups of up to three students can submit a single group homework solution. Students are responsible for forming their own homework groups, which can differ for each assignment. Only one student from a group should submit a solution (unless the group involves students from both BEE 4750 and 5750), and it is the responsibility of the student submitting the assignment to tell Gradescope the names of the other group members. If a group involves students from both BEE 4750 and 5750, solutions should be submitted separately for each sub-group due to the additional problem for 5750 students. Otherwise, if multiple solutions from the same group are submitted, only one will be graded (whichever first comes up in Gradescope) and the rest ignored.\nConsulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity. Graduate students in BEE 5750 can expect one additional problem for each homework assignment aimed at developing greater depth or familiarity with the material.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom. While GitHub use is not required for the class aside from accepting and cloning assignments, students are encouraged to update their GitHub repositories as they work on the assignments; this helps with answering questions, keeping solutions synced across groups, and gives you a backstop in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your assignment on time.\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date (usually a Thursday). Your assignment writeup should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in a non-negotiable 10% point deduction). All students in a group are responsible for ensuring that the student who submits the assignment for their group tags each question, as all will have points deducted if this is not done.\nA meta-rubric is provided on the website, under the Homework page. These are not customized for each assignment but the principles will apply generally.\nNo homework assignments will be dropped, but you can turn in assignments within 24 hours of the due date with a 50% penalty. If you need a further accomodation for a particular assignment, talk to Prof. Srikrishnan before the due date. Requests for extensions made after the due date will only be considered under extraordinary and unexpected circumstances. Technical challenges submitting assignments are not acceptable reasons for extensions to be granted, and late penalties will apply.\nYour submitted homework must stand on its own*! We cannot grade you on the basis of information which was not included in the submitted assignment. While regrade requests should include a justification for why your grade is incorrect, we will not consider explanations or additional reasoning outside of the submission.\n\n\n\nPrelims\nTwo in-class prelims will be given as an opportunity to review relevant material. The dates for the exams are Wednesday, 10/09 and Monday, 11/11. The exams are closed-book and closed-note. As a result, the exams will emphasize conceptual material such as model derivations and interpretation of results; any calculations can be done with a pen(cil) and paper. Conflict and extended-time exams will be handled through SDS. Exams will be scanned into Gradescope for grading and feedback.\nSolutions will not be posted for the midterms, but Prof. Srikrishnan will review and discuss midterm problems in class. The review will occur approximately two weeks after the exam to provide time for conflict exams and grading.\n\n\nFinal Term Project\nThis course will culminate with a term project. The goal of this project is to apply and extend the tools and approaches we will learn in class to an application of your choosing. While we encourage drawing on other classes or interests when developing and working on your project, submitting work from another course or work which was completed prior to the course is not permitted.\nThe term project will be completed in groups (3-4 students). Graduate students enrolled in BEE 5750 may work on individual projects, but are not required to do so. The final deliverable for this project will be a report summarizing the project and results, including a section detailing research you have conducted on relevant regulations and how they were incorporated into your project. Ahead of that, you will submit the following a proposal for feedback on the scope of your project as well as a description of task coordination.\nThe project will be assessed on the basis of both group and individual components:\n\nGroup (80 points):\n\n(10 points) Proposal: Groups will develop a proposal for their final project, which will include two main components. The first is a research plan, which should (succinctly) describe the background for the problem and articulate the key question (system overview, model specification) as well as providing a brief overview of proposed methods (data sources, planned analytic approach). The second is a work plan, which will include task assignments across group members, deadlines for interim tasks, and a plan for coordination (meeting frequency, materials sharing, etc).\n(20 points) Presentation: Groups will present their projects to the class at the end of the semester. Due to time restrictions, these may be recorded and uploaded to Canvas if there are too many projects for the time available. Presentations should be no more than 10 minutes long and should be aimed at a general audience.\n(10 points) Peer Review: Each group will be asked to provide a peer review on two of their classmates’ presentations. The format for the review will be made available on the class website.\n(40 points) Final Report: Each group will submit a 3-5 page final report aimed at an engineering audience. Instructions will be provided with detailed expectations.\n\nIndividual (20 points):\n\n(5 points) Self-Assessment: Each individual in a group will submit a short self-assessment of their project, including a description of the work they contributed to the project (&lt; 1/2 page) and reflections on what worked well or less well (&lt; 1/2 page).\n(15 points) Peer Evaluation: Each individual in a group will submit an evaluation of their teammates’ contributions to the final project and the group dynamic, including assessments of participation, work quality, and inclusivity. Points will be awarded based on the evaluations from your group; different scales will be applied for undergraduate (4750) and graduate (5750) students. No points will be given for any student who fails to submit evaluations for their groupmates.",

For example, you should assume that a score of 92.9% has missed the A cutoff of 93% (it is, after all, below the cutoff).

This does mean that e.g. submitted homeworks will carry more weight in the overall grade computation. In exceptional cases, we will compute course grades based entirely on exams.\n\n\nExceptions\nWe reserve the right to give any student meeting at least one of the following conditions an automatic F:\n\nOverall exam average below 25%;\nSubmitted less than half of the assigned homework problems;\nExtremely low levels of participation and effort.\n\nThis should not generally be a concern; students putting in a good faith effort by attending class, participating in online discussions, doing most of the work, and taking the exams will not be at risk of this policy.",
