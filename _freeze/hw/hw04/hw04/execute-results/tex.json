This should be at the start of most Julia scripts.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nimport Pkg\nPkg.activate(@__DIR__)\nPkg.instantiate()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing JuMP\nusing HiGHS\nusing DataFrames\nusing Plots\nusing Measures\nusing CSV\nusing MarkdownTables\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Problems (Total: 50/60 Points)\n\n### Problem 1 (20 points)\n\nA farmer has access to a pesticide which can be used on corn, soybeans, and wheat fields, and costs $70/kg-yr to apply. The crop yields the farmer can obtain following crop yields by applying varying rates of pesticides to the field are shown in @tbl-yields.\n\n| Application Rate (kg/ha) | Soybean (kg/ha) | Wheat (kg/ha) | Corn (kg/ha) |\n|:----------------------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|\n| 0 | 2900 | 3500 | 5900 |\n| 1 | 3800 | 4100 | 6700 |\n| 2 | 4400 | 4200 | 7900 |\n: Crop yields from applying varying pesticide rates for Problem 1. {#tbl-yields}\n\nThe costs of production, *excluding pesticides*, for each crop, and selling prices, are shown in @tbl-costs.\n\n| Crop | Production Cost (\\$/ha-yr) | Selling Price (\\$/kg) |\n|:----:|:--------------------------------:|:--------------------:|\n| Soybeans | 350 |  0.36 |\n| Wheat | 280 | 0.27 |\n| Corn | 390 | 0.22 |\n: Costs of crop production, excluding pesticides, and selling prices for each crop. {#tbl-costs}\n\nRecently, environmental authorities have declared that farms cannot have an *average* application rate on soybeans, wheat, and corn which exceeds 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 kg/ha, respectively. The farmer has asked you for advice on how they should plant crops and apply pesticides to maximize profits over 130 total ha while remaining in regulatory compliance if demand for each crop (which is the maximum the market would buy) this year is 250,000 kg?\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Formulate a linear program for this resource allocation problem, including clear definitions of decision variable(s) (including units), objective function(s), and constraint(s) (make sure to explain functions and constraints with any needed derivations and explanations). **Tip: Make sure that all of your constraints are linear**.\n* Implement the program in `JuMP.jl` and find the solution. How many ha should the farmer dedicate to each crop and with what pesticide application rate(s)? How much profit will the farmer expect to make?\n* The farmer has an opportunity to buy an extra 10 ha of land. How much extra profit would this land be worth to the farmer? Discuss why this value makes sense and whether you would recommend the farmer should make the purchase.\n\n### Problem 2 (30 points)\n\nFor this problem, we will use hourly load (demand) data from 2013 in New York's Zone C (which includes Ithaca). The load data is loaded and plotted below in @fig-demand.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# load the data, pull Zone C, and reformat the DataFrame\nNY_demand = DataFrame(CSV.File(\"data/2013_hourly_load_NY.csv\"))\nrename!(NY_demand, :\"Time Stamp\" => :Date)\ndemand = NY_demand[:, [:Date, :C]]\nrename!(demand, :C => :Demand)\ndemand[:, :Hour] = 1:nrow(demand)\n\n# plot demand\nplot(demand.Hour, demand.Demand, xlabel=\"Hour of Year\", ylabel=\"Demand (MWh)\", label=:false)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n![Hourly load data for New York's Zone C in 2013.](hw04_files/figure-pdf/fig-demand-output-1.svg){#fig-demand fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we load the generator data, shown in @tbl-generators. This data includes fixed costs (\\$/MW installed), variable costs (\\$/MWh generated), and CO~2~ emissions intensity (tCO~2~/MWh generated).\n\n::: {#tbl-generators .cell tbl-cap='Generator type data, including fixed costs (\\$/MW installed), variable costs (\\$/MWh generated), and CO~2~ emissions intensity (tCO~2~/MWh generated).' execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngens = DataFrame(CSV.File(\"data/generators.csv\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{tabular}{r|cccc}\n\t& Plant & FixedCost & VarCost & Emissions\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t& String15 & Int64 & Int64 & Float64\\\\\n\t\\hline\n\t1 & Geothermal & 450000 & 0 & 0.0 \\\\\n\t2 & Coal & 220000 & 24 & 1.0 \\\\\n\t3 & NG CCGT & 82000 & 30 & 0.43 \\\\\n\t4 & NG CT & 65000 & 40 & 0.55 \\\\\n\t5 & Wind & 91000 & 0 & 0.0 \\\\\n\t6 & Solar & 70000 & 0 & 0.0 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFinally, we load the hourly solar and wind capacity factors, which are plotted in @fig-cf. These tell us the fraction of installed capacity which is expected to be available in a given hour for generation (typically based on the average meteorology).\n\n::: {#fig-cf .cell layout-nrow='2' execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\n# load capacify factors into a DataFrame\ncap_factor = DataFrame(CSV.File(\"data/wind_solar_capacity_factors.csv\"))\n\n# plot January capacity factors\np1 = plot(cap_factor.Wind[1:(24*31)], label=\"Wind\")\nplot!(cap_factor.Solar[1:(24*31)], label=\"Solar\")\nxaxis!(\"Hour of the Month\")\nyaxis!(\"Capacity Factor\")\n\np2 = plot(cap_factor.Wind[4344:4344+(24*31)], label=\"Wind\")\nplot!(cap_factor.Solar[4344:4344+(24*31)], label=\"Solar\")\nxaxis!(\"Hour of the Month\")\nyaxis!(\"Capacity Factor\")\n\ndisplay(p1)\ndisplay(p2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![January](hw04_files/figure-pdf/fig-cf-output-1.svg){#fig-cf-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![July](hw04_files/figure-pdf/fig-cf-output-2.svg){#fig-cf-2}\n:::\n\nHourly solar and wind capacity factors.\n:::\n\n\n\nYou have been asked to develop a generating capacity expansion plan for the utility in Riley County, NY, which currently has no existing electrical generation infrastructure. The utility can build any of the following plant types: geothermal, coal, natural gas combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), natural gas combustion turbine (CT), solar, and wind. \n\nWhile coal, CCGT, and CT plants can generate at their full installed capacity, geothermal plants operate at maximum 85% capacity, and solar and wind available capacities vary by the hour depend on the expected meteorology. The utility will also penalize any non-served demand at a rate of $10,000/MWh.  \n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Formulate a linear program for this capacity expansion problem, including clear definitions of decision variable(s) (including units), objective function(s), and constraint(s) (make sure to explain functions and constraints with any needed derivations and explanations).\n* Implement your linear program in `JuMP.jl`. Find the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What will the total cost be? How much energy will be non-served?\n* What fraction of annual generation does each plant type produce? How does this compare to the breakdown of built capacity that you found in Problem 1.5? Do these results make sense given the generator data?\n* Make a plot of the electricity price in each hour. Discuss any trends that you see.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Significant Digits\n\nUse `round(x; digits=n)` to report values to the appropriate precision! If your number is on a different order of magnitude and you want to round to a certain number of significant digits, you can use `round(x; sigdigits=n)`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Getting Variable Output Values\n\n`value.(x)` will report the values of a `JuMP` variable `x`, but it will return a special container which holds other information about `x` that is useful for `JuMP`. This means that you can't use this output directly for further calculations. To just extract the values, use `value.(x).data`.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Suppressing Model Command Output\n\nThe output of specifying model components (variable or constraints) can be quite large for this problem because of the number of time periods. If you end a cell with an `@variable` or `@constraint` command, I *highly* recommend suppressing output by adding a semi-colon after the last command, or you might find that your notebook crashes.\n:::\n\n\n### Problem 3 (10 points)\n\n**This problem is only required for students in BEE 5750**.\n\nThe NY state legislature is considering enacting an annual CO~2~ limit, which for the utility would limit the emissions in its footprint to 1.5 MtCO~2~/yr.\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Reformulate your linear program from Problem 2 with any necessary changes to capture the CO~2~ limit.\n* Implement the new optimization problem and find the optimal solution. How much should the utility build of each type of generating plant? What is different from your plan from Problem 1? Do these changes make sense?\n* What would the value to the utility be of allowing it to emit an additional 1000 tCO~2~/yr? An additional 5000?\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n## References\n\nList any external references consulted, including classmates.\n:::\n\n",
